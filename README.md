# Computing for Mental Health Project

Research in the field of visualization often leverages work by cognitive and perceptual psychology to provide the foundation for new lines of inquiry. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between the tightly-controlled laboratory studies being referenced and the application of visualization tools in practice. This sometimes results in altered performance or unexpected analytical behaviors which are difficult to explain.

Indeed, the various fields that study human behavior have observed this problem for ages: laboratory psychology, clinical psychology, sociology, and social work (just to name a few) each take very different approaches to observing and explaining various behavioral phenomena. In collaboration with researchers and practitioners in the field of human services at the Justice Resource Institute, we are working to understand how our historically separate disciplines might better be able to support one another [1]:

    Leveraging what visualization research has learned about how to support complex reasoning, we work to co-create tools that can make an impact on the availability and efficacy of community-based mental health resources.
    In tandem, this collaboration provides opportunities for visualization researchers to learn complementary techniques for assessing and modulating human behavior with an emphasis on individual well-being and the well-being of society.
