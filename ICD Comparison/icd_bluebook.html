At that time, WHO convened a series of meetings to review knowledge, actively involving representatives of different disciplines, various schools of thought in psychiatry, and all parts of the world in the programme. It stimulated and conducted research on criteria for classification and for reliability of diagnosis, and produced and promulgated procedures for joint rating of videotaped interviews and other useful research methods. Numerous proposals to improve the classification of mental disorders resulted from the extensive consultation process, and these were used in drafting the Eighth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-8). A glossary defining each category of mental disorder in ICD-8 was also developed. The programme activities also resulted in the establishment of a network of individuals and centres who continued to work on issues related to the improvement of psychiatric classification (<i>1, 2</i>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 1970s saw further growth of interest in improving psychiatric classification worldwide. Expansion of international contacts, the undertaking of several international collaborative studies, and the availability of new treatments all contributed to this trend. Several national psychiatric bodies encouraged the development of specific criteria for classification in order to improve diagnostic reliability. In particular, the American Psychiatric Association developed and promulgated its Third Revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which incorporated operational criteria into its classification system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 1978, WHO entered into a long-term collaborative project with the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) in the USA, aiming to facilitate further improvements in the classification and diagnosis of mental disorders, and alcohol- and drug-related problems (<i>3</i>). A series of workshops brought together scientists from a number of different psychiatric traditions and cultures, reviewed knowledge in specified areas, and developed recommendations for future research. A major international conference on classification and diagnosis was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1982 to review the recommendations that emerged from these workshops and to outline a research agenda and guidelines for future work (<i>4</i>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Several major research efforts were undertaken to implement the recommendations of the Copenhagen conference. One of them, involving centres in 17 countries, had as its aim the development of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, an instrument suitable for conducting epidemiological studies of mental disorders in general population groups in different countries (<i>5</i>). Another major project focused on developing an assessment instrument suitable for use by clinicians (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry) (<i>6</i>). Still another study was initiated to develop an instrument for the assessment of personality disorders in different countries (the International Personality Disorder Examination) (<i>7</i>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, several lexicons have been, or are being, prepared to provide clear definitions of terms (<i>8</i>). A mutually beneficial relationship evolved between these projects and the work on definitions of mental and behavioural disorders in the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ICD-10) (<i>9</i>). Converting diagnostic criteria into diagnostic algorithms incorporated in the assessment instruments was useful in uncovering inconsistencies, ambiguities and overlap and allowing their removal. The work on refining the ICD-10 also helped to shape the assessment instruments. The final result was a clear set of criteria for ICD-10 and assessment instruments which can produce data necessary for the classification of disorders according to the criteria included in Chapter V(F) of ICD-10.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Copenhagen conference also recommended that the viewpoints of the different psychiatric traditions be presented in publications describing the origins of the classification in the ICD-10. This resulted in several major publications, including a volume that contains a series of presentations highlighting the origins of classification in contemporary psychiatry (<i>10</i>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The preparation and publication of this work, <i>Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines</i>, are the culmination of the efforts of numerous people who have contributed to it over many years. The work has gone through several major drafts, each prepared after extensive consultation with panels of experts, national and international psychiatric societies, and individual consultants. The draft in use in 1987 was the basis of field trials conducted in some 40 countries, which constituted the largest ever research effort of this type designed to improve psychiatric diagnosis (<i>11, 12</i>). The results of the trials were used in finalizing these guidelines.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This work is the first of a series of publications developed from Chapter V(F) of ICD-10. Other texts will include diagnostic criteria for researchers, a version for use by general health care workers, a multiaxial presentation, and &quot;crosswalks&quot; - allowing cross- reference between corresponding terms in ICD-10, ICD-9 and ICD-8.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Use of this publication is described in the Introduction, and a subsequent section of the book provides notes on some of the frequently discussed difficulties of classification. The Acknowledgements section is of particular significance since it bears witness to the vast number of individual experts and institutions, all over the world, who actively participated in the production of the classification and the guidelines. All the major traditions and schools of psychiatry are represented, which gives this work its uniquely international character. The classification and the guidelines were produced and tested in many languages; it is hoped that the arduous process of ensuring equivalence of translations has resulted in improvements in the clarity, simplicity and logical structure of the texts in English and in other languages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A classification is a way of seeing the world at a point in time. There is no doubt that scientific progress and experience with the use of these guidelines will ultimately require their revision and updating. I hope that such revisions will be the product of the same cordial and productive worldwide scientific collaboration as that which has produced the current text.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Norman Sartorius</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Director, Division of Mental Health World Health Organization</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">References</p><ol id="l1"><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: justify;"><p class="s1" style="display: inline;">Kramer, M. et al.

The field trials of the ICD-10 proposals, for example, involved researchers and clinicians in some 40 countries; it is clearly impossible to present a complete list of all those who participated in this effort. What follows is a mention of individuals and agencies whose contributions were central to the creation of the documents composing the ICD-10 family of classifications and guidelines.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The individuals who produced the initial drafts of the classification and guidelines are included in the list of principal investigators on pages 312-325: their names are marked by an asterisk. Dr A. Jablensky, then Senior Medical Officer in the Division of Mental Health of WHO, in Geneva, coordinated this part of the programme and thus made a major contribution to the proposals. Once the proposals for the classification were assembled and circulated for comment to WHO expert panels and many other individuals, including those listed below, an amended version of the classification was produced for field tests. These were conducted according to a protocol produced by WHO staff with the help of Dr J. Burke, Dr J.E. Cooper, and Dr J. Mezzich and involved a large number of centres, whose work was coordinated by Field Trial Coordinating Centres (FTCCs). The FTCCs (listed on pages xi-xii) also undertook the task of producing equivalent translations of the ICD in the languages used in their countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dr N. Sartorius had overall responsibility for the work on the classification of mental and behavioural disorders in ICD-10 and for the production of accompanying documents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Throughout the phase of field testing and subsequently, Dr J.E. Cooper acted as chief consultant to the project and provided invaluable guidance and help to the WHO coordinating team. Among the team members were Dr J. van Drimmelen, who has worked with WHO from the beginning of the process of developing ICD-10 proposals, and Mrs J. Wilson, who conscientiously and efficiently handled the innumerable administrative tasks linked to the field tests and other activities related to the projects. Mr</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A. L&#39;Hours provided generous support, ensuring compliance between the ICD-10 development in general and the production of this classification, and Mr G. Gemert produced the index.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A number of other consultants, including in particular Dr A. Bertelsen, Dr H. Dilling, Dr</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">J. López-Ibor, Dr C. Pull, Dr D. Regier, Dr M. Rutter and Dr N. Wig, were also closely involved in this work, functioning not only as heads of FTCCs for the field trials but also providing advice and guidance about issues in their area of expertise and relevant to the psychiatric traditions of the groups of countries about which they were particularly knowledgeable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among the agencies whose help was of vital importance were the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration in the USA, which provided generous support to the activities preparatory to the drafting of ICD-10, and which ensured effective and productive consultation between groups working on ICD-10 and those working on the fourth revision of the American Psychiatric Association&#39;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) classification; the WHO Advisory Committee on ICD-10, chaired by Dr E. Strömgren; and the World Psychiatric Association which, through its President, Dr</p><ol id="l2"><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p class="s1" style="display: inline;">Stefanis, and the special committee on classification, assembled comments of numerous psychiatrists in its member associations and gave most valuable advice during both the field trials and the finalization of the proposals. Other nongovernmental organizations in official and working relations with WHO, including the World Federation for Mental Health, the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the World Association of Social Psychiatry, the World Federation of Neurology, and the International Union of Psychological Societies, helped in many ways, as did the WHO Collaborating Centres for Research and Training in Mental Health, located in some 40 countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Governments of WHO Member States, including in particular Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the USA, also provided direct support to the process of developing the classification of mental and behavioural disorders, both through their designated contributions to WHO and through contributions and financial support to the centres that participated in this work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The ICD-10 proposals are thus a product of collaboration, in the true sense of the word, between very many individuals and agencies in numerous countries. They were produced in the hope that they will serve as a strong support to the work of the many who are concerned with caring for the mentally ill and their families, worldwide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No classification is ever perfect: further improvements and simplifications should become possible with increases in our knowledge and as experience with the classification accumulates. The task of collecting and digesting comments and results of tests of the classification will remain largely on the shoulders of the centres that collaborated with WHO in the development of the classification. Their addresses are listed below because it is hoped that they will continue to be involved in the improvement of the WHO classifications and associated materials in the future and to assist the Organization in this work as generously as they have so far.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Numerous publications have arisen from Field Trial Centres describing results of their studies in connection with ICD-10.

This version, <i>Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines</i>, is intended for general clinical, educational and service use. <i>Diagnostic criteria for research </i>has been produced for research purposes and is designed to be used in conjunction with this book. The much shorter glossary provided by Chapter V(F) for ICD-10 itself is suitable for use by coders or clerical workers, and also serves as a reference point for compatibility with other classifications; it is not recommended for use by mental health professionals. Shorter and simpler versions of the classifications for use by primary health care workers are now in preparation, as is a multiaxial scheme. <i>Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines </i>has been the starting point for the development of the different versions, and the utmost care has been taken to avoid problems of incompatibility between them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Layout</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is important that users study this general introduction, and also read carefully the additional introductory and explanatory texts at the beginning of several of the individual categories. This is particularly important for F23.-(Acute and transient psychotic disorders), and for the block F30-F39 (Mood [affective] disorders). Because of the long-standing and notoriously difficult problems associated with the description and classification of these disorders, special care has been taken to explain how the classification has been approached.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For each disorder, a description is provided of the main clinical features, and also of any important but less specific associated features. &quot;Diagnostic guidelines&quot; are then provided in most cases, indicating the number and balance of symptoms usually required before a confident diagnosis can be made. The guidelines are worded so that a degree of flexibility is retained for diagnostic decisions in clinical work, particularly in the situation where provisional diagnosis may have to be made before the clinical picture is entirely clear or information is complete. To avoid repetition, clinical descriptions and some general diagnostic guidelines are provided for certain groups of disorders, in addition to those that relate only to individual disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When the requirements laid down in the diagnostic guidelines are clearly fulfilled, the diagnosis can be regarded as &quot;confident&quot;. When the requirements are only partially fulfilled, it is nevertheless useful to record a diagnosis for most purposes. It is then for the diagnostician and other users of the diagnostic statements to decide whether to record the lesser degrees of confidence (such as &quot;provisional&quot; if more information is yet to come, or &quot;tentative&quot; if more information is unlikely to become available) that are implied in these circumstances. Statements about the duration of symptoms are also intended as general guidelines rather than strict requirements; clinicians should use their own judgement about the appropriateness of choosing diagnoses when the duration of particular symptoms is slightly longer or shorter than that specified.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The diagnostic guidelines should also provide a useful stimulus for clinical teaching, since they serve as a reminder about points of clinical practice that can be found in a fuller form in most textbooks of psychiatry. They may also be suitable for some types of</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">research projects, where the greater precision (and therefore restriction) of the diagnostic criteria for research are not required.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These descriptions and guidelines carry no theoretical implications, and they do not pretend to be comprehensive statements about the current state of knowledge of the disorders. They are simply a set of symptoms and comments that have been agreed, by a large number of advisors and consultants in many different countries, to be a reasonable basis for defining the limits of categories in the classification of mental disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Principal differences between Chapter V(F) of ICD-10 and Chapter V of ICD-9</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">General principles of ICD-10</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ICD-10 is much larger than ICD-9. Numeric codes (001-999) were used in ICD-9, whereas an alphanumeric coding scheme, based on codes with a single letter followed by two numbers at the three-character level (A00-Z99), has been adopted in ICD-10. This has significantly enlarged the number of categories available for the classification. Further detail is then provided by means of decimal numeric subdivisions at the four-character level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The chapter that dealt with mental disorders in ICD-9 had only 30 three-character categories (290-319); Chapter V(F) of ICD-10 has 100 such categories. A proportion of these categories has been left unused for the time being, so as to allow the introduction of changes into the classification without the need to redesign the entire system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ICD-10 as a whole is designed to be a central (&quot;core&quot;) classification for a family of disease- and health-related classifications. Some members of the family of classifications are derived by using a fifth or even sixth character to specify more detail. In others, the categories are condensed to give broad groups suitable for use, for instance, in primary health care or general medical practice. There is a multiaxial presentation of Chapter V(F) of ICD-10 and a version for child psychiatric practice and research. The &quot;family&quot; also includes classifications that cover information not contained in the ICD, but having important medical or health implications, e.g. the classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps, the classification of procedures in medicine, and the classification of reasons for encounter between patients and health workers.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Neurosis and psychosis</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The traditional division between neurosis and psychosis that was evident in ICD-9 (although deliberately left without any attempt to define these concepts) has not been used in ICD-10. However, the term &quot;neurotic&quot; is still retained for occasional use and occurs, for instance, in the heading of a major group (or block) of disorders F40-F48, &quot;Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders&quot;. Except for depressive neurosis, most of the disorders regarded as neuroses by those who use the concept are to be found in this block,and the remainder are in the subsequent blocks. Instead of following the neurotic-psychotic dichotomy, the disorders are now arranged in groups according to major common themes or descriptive likenesses, which makes for increased convenience of use. For instance, cyclothymia (F34.0) is in the block F30-F39, Mood [affective] disorders, rather than in F60-F69, Disorders of adult personality and behaviour; similarly, all disorders associated with the use of psychoactive substances are grouped together in F10-F19, regardless of their severity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Psychotic&quot; has been retained as a convenient descriptive term, particularly in F23, Acute and transient psychotic disorders. Its use does not involve assumptions about psychodynamic mechanisms, but simply indicates the presence of hallucinations, delusions, or a limited number of severe abnormalities of behaviour, such as gross excitement and overactivity, marked psychomotor retardation, and catatonic behaviour.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other differences between ICD-9 and ICD-10</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All disorders attributable to an organic cause are grouped together in the block F00-F09, which makes the use of this part of the classification easier than the arrangement in the ICD-9.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The new arrangement of mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use in the block F10-F19 has also been found more useful than the earlier system. The third character indicates the substance used, the fourth and fifth characters the psychopathological syndrome, e.g. from acute intoxication and residual states; this allows the reporting of all disorders related to a substance even when only three-character categories are used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The block that covers schizophrenia, schizotypal states and delusional disorders (F20-F29) has been expanded by the introduction of new categories such as undifferentiated schizophrenia, postschizophrenic depression, and schizotypal disorder. The classification of acute short-lived psychoses, which are commonly seen in most developing countries, is considerably expanded compared with that in the ICD-9.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Classification of affective disorders has been particularly influenced by the adoption of the principle of grouping together disorders with a common theme. Terms such as &quot;neurotic depression&quot; and &quot;endogenous depression&quot; are not used, but their close equivalents can be found in the different types and severities of depression now specified (including dysthymia (F34.1)).</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The behavioural syndromes and mental disorders associated with physiological dysfunction and hormonal changes, such as eating disorders, nonorganic sleep disorders, and sexual dysfunctions, have been brought together in F50-F59 and described in greater detail than in ICD-9, because of the growing needs for such a classification in liaison psychiatry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Block F60-F69 contains a number of new disorders of adult behaviour such as pathological gambling, fire-setting, and stealing, as well as the more traditional disorders of personality. Disorders of sexual preference are clearly differentiated from disorders of gender identity, and homosexuality in itself is no longer included as a category.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some further comments about changes between the provisions for the coding of disorders specific to childhood and mental retardation can be found on pages 18-20.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Problems of terminology</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disorder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The term &quot;disorder&quot; is used throughout the classification, so as to avoid even greater problems inherent in the use of terms such as &quot;disease&quot; and &quot;illness&quot;. &quot;Disorder&quot; is not an exact term, but it is used here to imply the existence of a clinically recognizable set of symptoms or behaviour associated in most cases with distress and with interference with personal functions. Social deviance or conflict alone, without personal dysfunction, should not be included in mental disorder as defined here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Psychogenic and psychosomatic</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The term &quot;psychogenic&quot; has not been used in the titles of categories, in view of its different meanings in different languages and psychiatric traditions. It still occurs occasionally in the text, and should be taken to indicate that the diagnostician regards obvious life events or difficulties as playing an important role in the genesis of the disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Psychosomatic&quot; is not used for similar reasons and also because use of this term might be taken to imply that psychological factors play no role in the occurrence, course and outcome of other diseases that are not so described. Disorders described as psychosomatic in other classifications can be found here in F45.- (somatoform disorders), F50.- (eating disorders), F52.- (sexual dysfunction), and F54.- (psychological or behavioural factors associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere). It is particularly important to note category F54.- (category 316 in ICD-9) and to remember to use it for specifying the association of physical disorders, coded elsewhere in ICD-10, with an emotional causation. A common example would be the recording of psychogenic asthma or eczema by means of both F54 from Chapter V(F) and the appropriate code for the physical condition from other chapters in ICD-10.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Impairment, disability, handicap and related terms</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The terms &quot;impairment&quot;, &quot;disability&quot; and &quot;handicap&quot; are used according to the recommendations of the system adopted by WHO.<span class="s5">1 </span>Occasionally, where justified by clinical tradition, the terms are used in a broader sense.

A number of disorders placed in other categories can occur in persons of almost any age, and should be used for children and adolescents when required. Examples are disorders of eating (F50.-), sleeping (F51.-) and gender identity (F64.-). Some types of phobia occurring in children pose special problems for classification, as noted in the description of F93.1 (phobic anxiety disorder of childhood).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recording more than one diagnosis</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is recommended that clinicians should follow the general rule of recording as many diagnoses as are necessary to cover the clinical picture. When recording more than one diagnosis, it is usually best to give one precedence over the others by specifying it as the main diagnosis, and to label any others as subsidiary or additional diagnoses. Precedence should be given to that diagnosis most relevant to the purpose for which the diagnoses are being collected; in clinical work this is often the disorder that gave rise to the consultation or contact with health services. In many cases it will be the disorder that necessitates admission to an inpatient, outpatient or day-care service. At other times, for example when reviewing the patient&#39;s whole career, the most important diagnosis may well be the &quot;life-time&quot; diagnosis, which could be different from the one most relevant to the immediate consultation (for instance a patient with chronic schizophrenia presenting for an episode of care because of symptoms of acute anxiety). If there is any doubt about the order in which to record several diagnoses, or the diagnostician is uncertain of the purpose for which information will be used, a useful rule is to record the diagnoses in the numerical order in which they appear in the classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recording diagnoses from other chapters of ICD-10</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The use of other chapters of the ICD-10 system in addition to Chapter V(F) is strongly recommended.

Brief notes are presented here on some of the issues that were raised.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dementia (F01-F03) and its relationships with impairment, disability and handicap</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although a decline in cognitive abilities is essential for the diagnosis of dementia, no consequent interference with the performance of social roles, either within the family or with regard to employment, is used as a diagnostic guideline or criterion. This is a particular instance of a general principle that applies to the definitions of all the disorders in Chapter V(F) of ICD-10, adopted because of the wide variations between different cultures, religions, and nationalities in terms of work and social roles that are available, or regarded as appropriate. Nevertheless, once a diagnosis has been made using other information, the extent to which an individual&#39;s work, family, or leisure activities are hindered or even prevented is often a useful indicator of the severity of a disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is an opportune moment to refer to the general issue of the relationships between symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and the system adopted by WHO for describing impairment, disability, and handicap.<span class="s5">2 </span>In terms of this system, <i>impairment </i>(i.e. a &quot;loss or</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">abnormality... of structure or function&quot;) is manifest psychologically by interference with mental functions such as memory, attention, and emotive functions. Many types of psychological impairment have always been recognized as psychiatric symptoms. To a lesser degree, some types of <i>disability </i>(defined in the WHO system as &quot;a restriction or lack... of ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being&quot;) have also conventionally been regarded as psychiatric symptoms. Examples of disability at the personal level include the ordinary, and usually necessary, activities of daily life involved in personal care and survival related to washing, dressing, eating, and excretion. Interference with these activities is often a direct consequence of psychological impairment, and is influenced little, if at all, by culture. Personal disabilities can therefore legitimately appear among diagnostic guidelines and criteria, particularly for dementia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In contrast, a <i>handicap </i>(&quot;the disadvantage for an individual... that prevents or limits the performance of a role that is normal...for that individual&quot;) represents the effects of impairments or disabilities in a wide social context that may be heavily influenced by culture. Handicaps should therefore not be used as essential components of a diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Duration of symptoms required for schizophrenia (F20.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Prodromal states</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Before the appearance of typical schizophrenic symptoms, there is sometimes a period of weeks or months - particularly in young people - during which a prodrome of nonspecific symptoms appears (such as loss of interest, avoiding the company of others, staying away from work, being irritable and oversensitive). These symptoms are not diagnostic of any particular disorder, but neither are they typical of the healthy state of the individual. They are often just as distressing to the family and as incapacitating to the patient as the more clearly morbid symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, which develop later. Viewed retrospectively, such prodromal states seem to be an important part of the development of the disorder, but little systematic information is available as to whether similar prodromes are common in other psychiatric disorders, or whether similar states appear and disappear from time to time in individuals who never develop any diagnosable psychiatric disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If a prodrome typical of and specific to schizophrenia could be identified, described reliably, and shown to be uncommon in those with other psychiatric disorders and those with no disorders at all, it would be justifiable to include a prodrome among the optional criteria for schizophrenia. For the purposes of ICD-10, it was considered that insufficient information is available on these points at present to justify the inclusion of a prodromal state as a contributor to this diagnosis. An additional, closely related, and still unsolved problem is the extent to which such prodromes can be distinguished from schizoid and paranoid personality disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Separation of acute and transient psychotic disorders (F23.-) from schizophrenia (F20.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In ICD-10, the diagnosis of schizophrenia depends upon the presence of typical delusions, hallucinations or other symptoms (described on pages 86-89), and a minimum duration of 1 month is specified.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Strong clinical traditions in several countries, based on descriptive though not epidemiological studies, contribute towards the conclusion that, whatever the nature of the dementia praecox of Kraepelin and the schizophrenias of Bleuler, it, or they, are not the same as very acute psychoses that have an abrupt onset, a short course of a few weeks or even days, and a favourable outcome. Terms such as &quot;bouffée délirante&quot;, &quot;psychogenic psychosis&quot;, &quot;schizophreniform psychosis&quot;, &quot;cycloid psychosis&quot; and &quot;brief reactive psychosis&quot; indicate the widespread but diverse opinion and traditions that have developed. Opinions and evidence also vary as to whether transient but typical schizophrenic symptoms may occur with these disorders, and whether they are usually or always associated with acute psychological stress (bouffée délirante, at least, was originally described as not usually associated with an obvious psychological precipitant).</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Given the present lack of knowledge about both schizophrenia and these more acute disorders, it was considered that the best option for ICD-10 would be to allow sufficient time for the symptoms of the acute disorders to appear, be recognized, and largely subside, before a diagnosis of schizophrenia was made. Most clinical reports and authorities suggest that, in the large majority of patients with these acute psychoses, onset of psychotic symptoms occurs over a few days, or over 1-2 weeks at most, and that many patients recover with or without medication within 2-3 weeks. It therefore seems appropriate to specify 1 month as the transition point between the acute disorders in which symptoms of the schizophrenic type have been a feature and schizophrenia itself. For patients with psychotic, but non-schizophrenic, symptoms that persist beyond the 1-month point, there is no need to change the diagnosis until the duration requirement of delusional disorder (F22.0) is reached (3 months, as discussed below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A similar duration suggests itself when acute symptomatic psychoses (amphetamine psychosis is the best example) are considered. Withdrawal of the toxic agent is usually followed by disappearance of the symptoms over 8-10 days, but since it often takes 7-10 days for the symptoms to become manifest and troublesome (and for the patient to present to the psychiatric services), the overall duration is often 20 days or more. About 30 days, or 1 month, would therefore seem an appropriate time to allow as an overall duration before calling the disorder schizophrenia, if the typical symptoms persist. To adopt a 1-month duration of typical psychotic symptoms as a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of schizophrenia rejects the assumption that schizophrenia must be of comparatively long duration. A duration of 6 months has been adopted in more than one national classification, but in the present state of ignorance there appear to be no</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">advantages in restricting the diagnosis of schizophrenia in this way. In two large international collaborative studies on schizophrenia and related disorders<span class="s5">3</span>, the second of which was epidemiologically based, a substantial proportion of patients were found whose clear and typical schizophrenic symptoms lasted for more than 1 month but less</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">than 6 months, and who made good, if not complete, recoveries from the disorder. It therefore seems best for the purposes of ICD-10 to avoid any assumption about necessary chronicity for schizophrenia, and to regard the term as descriptive of a syndrome with a variety of causes (many of which are still unknown) and a variety of outcomes, depending upon the balance of genetic, physical, social, and cultural influences.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">There has also been considerable debate about the most appropriate duration of symptoms to specify as necessary for the diagnosis of persistent delusional disorder (F22.-).

The whole subject of the relationship between the disorders under discussion awaits more and better information than is at present available; a comparatively simple solution, which gives precedence to the acute and transient states, seemed the best option, and perhaps one that will stimulate research.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The principle of describing and classifying a disorder or group of disorders so as to display options rather than to use built-in assumptions, has been used for acute and transient psychotic disorders (F23.-); these and related points are discussed briefly in the introduction to that category (pages 97-99).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The term &quot;schizophreniform&quot; has not been used for a defined disorder in this classification. This is because it has been applied to several different clinical concepts over the last few decades, and associated with various mixtures of characteristics such as acute onset, comparatively brief duration, atypical symptoms or mixtures of symptoms, and a comparatively good outcome. There is no evidence to suggest a preferred choice for its usage, so the case for its inclusion as a diagnostic term was considered to be weak. Moreover, the need for an intermediate category of this type is obviated by the use of F23.- (acute and transient psychotic disorders) and its subdivisions, together with the requirement of 1 month of psychotic symptoms for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. As guidance for those who do use schizophreniform as a diagnostic term, it has been inserted in several places as an inclusion term relevant to those disorders that have the most overlap with the meanings it has acquired. These are: &quot;schizophreniform attack or psychosis, NOS&quot; in F20.8 (other schizophrenia), and &quot;brief schizophreniform disorder or psychosis&quot; in F23.2 (acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Simple schizophrenia (F20.6)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This category has been retained because of its continued use in some countries, and because of the uncertainty about its nature and its relationships to schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal disorder, which will require additional information for resolution. The criteria proposed for its differentiation highlight the problems of defining the mutual boundaries of this whole group of disorders in practical terms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Schizoaffective disorders (F25.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The evidence at present available as to whether schizoaffective disorders (F25.-) as defined in the ICD-10 should be placed in block F20-F29 (schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders) or in F30-F39 (mood [affective] disorders) is fairly evenly balanced. The final decision to place it in F20-F29 was influenced by feedback from the field trials of the 1987 draft, and by comments resulting from the worldwide circulation of the same draft to member societies of the World Psychiatric Association. It is clear that widespread and strong clinical traditions exist that favour its retention among schizophrenia and delusional disorders. It is relevant to this discussion that, given a set of affective symptoms, the addition of only mood-incongruent delusions is not sufficient to change the diagnosis to a schizoaffective category. At least one typically schizophrenic</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">symptom must be present with the affective symptoms during the same episode of the disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mood [affective] disorders (F30-F39)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It seems likely that psychiatrists will continue to disagree about the classification of disorders of mood until methods of dividing the clinical syndromes are developed that rely at least in part upon physiological or biochemical measurement, rather than being limited as at present to clinical descriptions of emotions and behaviour. As long as this limitation persists, one of the major choices lies between a comparatively simple classification with only a few degrees of severity, and one with greater details and more subdivisions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 1987 draft of ICD-10 used in the field trials had the merit of simplicity, containing, for example, only mild and severe depressive episodes, no separation of hypomania from mania, and no recommendation to specify the presence or absence of familiarly clinical concepts, such as the &quot;somatic&quot; syndrome or affective hallucinations and delusions. However, feedback from many of the clinicians involved in the field trials, and other comments received from a variety of sources, indicated a widespread demand for opportunities to specify several grades of depression and the other features noted above. In addition, it is clear from the preliminary analysis of field trial data that in many centres the category of &quot;mild depressive episode&quot; often had a comparatively low inter-rater reliability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It has also become evident that the views of clinicians on the required number of subdivisions of depression are strongly influenced by the types of patient they encounter most frequently. Those working in primary care, outpatient clinics and liaison settings need ways of describing patients with mild but clinically significant states of depression, whereas those whose work is mainly with inpatients frequently need to use the more extreme categories.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further consultations with experts on affective disorders resulted in the present versions. Options for specifying several aspects of affective disorders have been included, which, although still some way from being scientifically respectable, are regarded by psychiatrists in many parts of the world as clinically useful. It is hoped that their inclusion will stimulate further discussion and research into their true clinical value.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unsolved problems remain about how best to define and make diagnostic use of the incongruence of delusions with mood. There would seem to be both enough evidence and sufficient clinical demand for the inclusion of provisions for mood-congruent or mood-incongruent delusions to be included, at least as an &quot;optional extra&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recurrent brief depressive disorder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since the introduction of ICD-9, sufficient evidence has accumulated to justify the provision of a special category for the brief episodes of depression that meet the severity criteria but not the duration criteria for depressive episode (F32.-). These recurrent states are of unclear nosological significance and the provision of a category for their recording</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">should encourage the collection of information that will lead to a better understanding of their frequency and long-term course.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Agoraphobia and panic disorder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There has been considerable debate recently as to which of agoraphobia and panic disorder should be regarded as primary. From an international and cross-cultural perspective, the amount and type of evidence available does not appear to justify rejection of the still widely accepted notion that the phobic disorder is best regarded as the prime disorder, with attacks of panic usually indicating its severity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mixed categories of anxiety and depression</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Psychiatrists and others, especially in developing countries, who see patients in primary health care services should find particular use for F41.2 (mixed anxiety and depressive disorder), F41.3 (other mixed disorders), the various subdivisions of F43.2 (adjustment disorder), and F44.7 (mixed dissociative [conversion] disorder). The purpose of these categories is to facilitate the description of disorders manifest by a mixture of symptoms for which a simpler and more traditional psychiatric label is not appropriate but which nevertheless represent significantly common, severe states of distress and interference with functioning. They also result in frequent referral to primary care, medical and psychiatric services. Difficulties in using these categories reliably may be encountered, but it is important to test them and - if necessary - improve their definition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dissociative and somatoform disorders, in relation to hysteria</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The term &quot;hysteria&quot; has not been used in the title for any disorder in Chapter V(F) of ICD-10 because of its many and varied shades of meaning. Instead, &quot;dissociative&quot; has been preferred, to bring together disorders previously termed hysteria, of both dissociative and conversion types. This is largely because patients with the dissociative and conversion varieties often share a number of other characteristics, and in addition they frequently exhibit both varieties at the same or different times. It also seems reasonable to presume that the same (or very similar) psychological mechanisms are common to both types of symptoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There appears to be widespread international acceptance of the usefulness of grouping together several disorders with a predominantly physical or somatic mode of presentation under the term &quot;somatoform&quot;. For the reasons already given, however, this new concept was not considered to be an adequate reason for separating amnesias and fugues from dissociative sensory and motor loss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If multiple personality disorder (F44.81) does exist as something other than a culture-specific or even iatrogenic condition, then it is presumably best placed among the dissociative group.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Neurasthenia</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although omitted from some classification systems, neurasthenia has been retained as a category in ICD-10, since this diagnosis is still regularly and widely used in a number of countries. Research carried out in various settings has demonstrated that a significant proportion of cases diagnosed as neurasthenia can also be classified under depression or anxiety: there are, however, cases in which the clinical syndrome does not match the description of any other category but does meet all the criteria specified for a syndrome of neurasthenia. It is hoped that further research on neurasthenia will be stimulated by its inclusion as a separate category.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Culture-specific disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The need for a separate category for disorders such as latah, amok, koro, and a variety of other possibly culture-specific disorders has been expressed less often in recent years. Attempts to identify sound descriptive studies, preferably with an epidemiological basis, that would strengthen the case for these inclusions as disorders clinically distinguishable from others already in the classification have failed, so they have not been separately classified. Descriptions of these disorders currently available in the literature suggest that they may be regarded as local variants of anxiety, depression, somatoform disorder, or adjustment disorder; the nearest equivalent code should therefore be used if required, together with an additional note of which culture-specific disorder is involved. There may also be prominent elements of attention-seeking behaviour or adoption of the sick role akin to that described in F68.1 (intentional production or feigning of symptoms or disabilities), which can also be recorded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mental and behavioural disorders associated with the puerperium (F53.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This category is unusual and apparently paradoxical in carrying a recommendation that it should be used only when unavoidable. Its inclusion is a recognition of the very real practical problems in many developing countries that make the gathering of details about many cases of puerperal illness virtually impossible. However, even in the absence of sufficient information to allow a diagnosis of some variety of affective disorder (or, more rarely, schizophrenia), there will usually be enough known to allow diagnosis of a mild (F53.0) or severe (F53.1) disorder; this subdivision is useful for estimations of workload, and when decisions are to be made about provision of services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The inclusion of this category should not be taken to imply that, given adequate information, a significant proportion of cases of postpartum mental illness cannot be classified in other categories. Most experts in this field are of the opinion that a clinical picture of puerperal psychosis is so rarely (if ever) reliably distinguishable from affective disorder or schizophrenia that a special category is not justified. Any psychiatrist who is of the minority opinion that special postpartum psychoses do indeed exist may use this category, but should be aware of its real purpose.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disorders of adult personality (F60.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In all current psychiatric classifications, disorders of adult personality include a variety of severe problems, whose solution requires information that can come only from extensive and time-consuming investigations. The difference between observations and interpretation becomes particularly troublesome when attempts are made to write detailed guidelines or diagnostic criteria for these disorders; and the number of criteria that must be fulfilled before a diagnosis is regarded as confirmed remains an unsolved problem in the light of present knowledge. Nevertheless, the attempts that have been made to specify guidelines and criteria for this category may help to demonstrate that a new approach to the description of personality disorders is required.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After initial hesitation, a brief description of borderline personality disorder (F60.31) was finally included as a subcategory of emotionally unstable personality disorder (F60.3), again in the hope of stimulating investigations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other disorders of adult personality and behaviour (F68)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Two categories that have been included here but were not present in ICD-9 are F68.0, elaboration of physical symptoms for psychological reasons, and F68.1, intentional production or feigning of symptoms or disabilities, either physical or psychological [factitious disorder]. Since these are, strictly speaking, disorders of role or illness behaviour, it should be convenient for psychiatrists to have them grouped with other disorders of adult behaviour. Together with malingering (Z76.5), which has always been outside Chapter V of the ICD, the disorders from a trio of diagnoses often need to be considered together. The crucial difference between the first two and malingering is that the motivation for malingering is obvious and usually confined to situations where personal danger, criminal sentencing, or large sums of money are involved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mental retardation (F70-F79)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The policy for Chapter V(F) of ICD-10 has always been to deal with mental retardation as briefly and as simply as possible, acknowledging that justice can be done to this topic only by means of a comprehensive, possibly multiaxial, system. Such a system needs to be developed separately, and work to produce appropriate proposals for international use is now in progress.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disorders with onset specific to childhood</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">F80-F89 Disorders of psychological development</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disorders of childhood such as infantile autism and disintegrative psychosis, classified in ICD-9 as psychoses, are now more appropriately contained in F84.-, pervasive developmental disorders. While some uncertainty remains about their nosological status, it has been considered that sufficient information is now available to justify the inclusion of the syndromes of Rett and Asperger in this group as specified disorders. Overactive disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped movements (F84.4) has been included in spite of its mixed nature, because evidence suggests that this may have considerable practical utility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F90-F98 Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Differences in international opinion about the broadness of the concept of hyperkinetic disorder have been a well-known problem for many years, and were discussed in detail at the meetings between WHO advisors and other experts held under the auspices of the WHO-ADAMHA joint project. Hyperkinetic disorder is now defined more broadly in ICD-10 than it was in ICD-9. The ICD-10 definition is also different in the relative emphasis given to the constituent symptoms of the overall hyperkinetic syndrome; since recent empirical research was used as the basis for the definition, there are good reasons for believing that the definition in ICD-10 represents a significant improvement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hyperkinetic conduct disorder (F90.1) is one of the few examples of a combination category remaining in ICD-10, Chapter V(F). The use of this diagnosis indicates that the criteria for both hyperkinetic disorder (F90.-) and conduct disorder (F91.-) are fulfilled. These few exceptions to the general rule were considered justified on the grounds of clinical convenience in view of the frequent coexistence of those disorders and the demonstrated later importance of the mixed syndrome. However, it is likely that <i>The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Diagnostic criteria for research </i>(DCR-10) will recommend that, for research purposes, individual cases in these categories be described in terms of hyperactivity, emotional disturbance, and severity of conduct disorder (in addition to the combination category being used as an overall diagnosis).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Oppositional defiant disorder (F91.3) was not in ICD-9, but has been included in ICD-10 because of evidence of its predictive potential for later conduct problems. There is, however, a cautionary note recommending its use mainly for younger children.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The ICD-9 category 313 (disturbances of emotion specific to childhood and adolescence) has been developed into two separate categories for ICD-10, namely emotional disorders with onset specific to childhood (F93.-) and disorders of social functioning with onset specific to childhood and adolescence (F94.-). This is because of the continuing need for a differentiation between children and adults with respect to various forms of morbid anxiety and related emotions. The frequency with which emotional disorders in childhood are followed by no significant similar disorder in adult life, and the frequent onset of neurotic disorders in adults are clear indicators of this</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">need. The key defining criterion used in ICD-10 is the appropriateness to the developmental stage of the child of the emotion shown, plus an unusual degree of persistence with disturbance of function. In other words, these childhood disorders are significant exaggerations of emotional states and reactions that are regarded as normal for the age in question when occurring in only a mild form. If the content of the emotional state is unusual, or if it occurs at an unusual age, the general categories elsewhere in the classification should be used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In spite of its name, the new category F94.- (disorders of social functioning with onset specific to childhood and adolescence) does not go against the general rule for ICD-10 of not using interference with social roles as a diagnostic criterion. The abnormalities of social functioning involved in F94.- are of a limited number and contained within the parent-child relationship and the immediate family; these relationships do not have the same connotations or show the same cultural variations as those formed in the context of work or of providing for the family, which are excluded from use as diagnostic criteria.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A number of categories that will be used frequently by child psychiatrists, such as eating disorders (F50.-), nonorganic sleep disorders (F51.-), and gender identity disorders (F64.-), are to be found in the general sections of the classifications because of their frequent onset and occurrence in adults as well as children. Nevertheless, clinical features specific to childhood were thought to justify the additional categories of feeding disorder of infancy (F98.2) and pica of infancy and childhood (F98.3).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Users of blocks F80-F89 and F90-F98 also need to be aware of the contents of the neurological chapter of ICD-10 (Chapter VI(G)). This contains syndromes with predominantly physical manifestations and clear &quot;organic&quot; etiology, of which the Kleine-Levin syndrome (G47.8) is of particular interest to child psychiatrists.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unspecified mental disorder (F99)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are practical reasons why a category for the recording of &quot;unspecified mental disorder&quot; is required in ICD-10, but the subdivision of the whole of the classificatory space available for Chapter V(F) into 10 blocks, each covering a specific area, posed a problem for this requirement. It was decided that the least unsatisfactory solution was to use the last category in the numerical order of the classification, i.e. F99.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deletion of categories proposed for earlier drafts of ICD-10</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The process of consultation and reviews of the literature that preceded the drafting of Chapter V(F) of ICD-10 resulted in numerous proposals for changes. Decisions on whether to accept or reject proposals were influenced by a number of factors. These included the results of the field tests of the classification, consultations with heads of WHO collaborative centres, results of collaboration with nongovernmental organizations, advice from members of WHO expert advisory panels, results of translations of the classification, and the constraints of the rules governing the structure of the ICD as a whole.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It was normally easy to reject proposals that were idiosyncratic and unsupported by evidence, and to accept others that were accompanied by sound justification. Some proposals, although reasonable when considered in isolation, could not be accepted because of the implications that even minor changes to one part of the classification would have for other parts. Some other proposals had clear merit, but more research would be necessary before they could be considered for international use. A number of these proposals included in early versions of the general classification were omitted from the final version, including &quot;accentuation of personality traits&quot; and &quot;hazardous use of psychoactive substances&quot;. It is hoped that research into the status and usefulness of these and other innovative categories will continue.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent:

left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This block comprises`a range of mental disorders grouped together on the basis of their common, demonstrable etiology in cerebral disease, brain injury, or other insult leading to cerebral dysfunction. The dysfunction may be <i>primary</i>, as in diseases, injuries, and insults that affect the brain directly or with predilection; or <i>secondary</i>, as in systemic diseases and disorders that attack the brain only as one of the multiple organs or systems of the body involved. Alcohol- and drug-caused brain disorders, though logically belonging to this group, are classified under F10-F19 because of practical advantages in keeping all disorders due to psychoactive substance use in a single block.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although the spectrum of psychopathological manifestations of the conditions included here is broad, the essential features of the disorders form two main clusters. On the one hand, there are syndromes in which the invariable and most prominent features are either disturbances of cognitive functions, such as memory, intellect, and learning, or disturbances of the sensorium, such as disorders of consciousness and attention. On the other hand, there are syndromes of which the most conspicuous manifestations are in the areas of perception (hallucinations), thought contents (delusions), or mood and emotion (depression, elation, anxiety), or in the overall pattern of personality and behaviour, while cognitive or sensory dysfunction is minimal or difficult to ascertain. The latter group of disorders has less secure footing in this block than the former because it contains many disorders that are symptomatically similar to conditions classified in other blocks (F20-F29, F30-F39, F40-F49, F60-F69) and are known to occur without gross cerebral pathological change or dysfunction. However, the growing evidence that a variety of cerebral and systemic diseases are causally related to the occurrence of such syndromes provides sufficient justification for their inclusion here in a clinically oriented classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The majority of the disorders in this block can, at least theoretically, have their onset at any age, except perhaps early childhood. In practice, most tend to start in adult life or old age. While some of these disorders are seemingly irreversible and progressive, others are transient or respond to currently available treatments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Use of the term &quot;organic&quot; does not imply that conditions elsewhere in this classification are &quot;nonorganic&quot; in the sense of having no cerebral substrate. In the present context, the term &quot;organic&quot; means simply that the syndrome so classified can be attributed to an independently diagnosable cerebral or systemic disease or disorder. The term &quot;symptomatic&quot; is used for those organic mental disorders in which cerebral involvement is secondary to a systemic extracerebral disease or disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It follows from the foregoing that, in the majority of cases, the recording of a diagnosis of any one of the disorders in this block will require the use of two codes: one for the psychopathological syndrome and another for the underlying disorder.

Consciousness is not clouded. Impairments of cognitive function are commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behaviour, or motivation. This syndrome occurs in Alzheimer&#39;s disease, in cerebrovascular disease, and in other conditions primarily or secondarily affecting the brain.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In assessing the presence or absence of a dementia, special care should be taken to avoid false-positive identification: motivational or emotional factors, particularly depression, in addition to motor slowness and general physical frailty, rather than loss of intellectual capacity, may account for failure to perform.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dementia produces an appreciable decline in intellectual functioning, and usually some interference with personal activities of daily living, such as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, excretory and toilet activities. How such a decline manifests itself will depend largely on the social and cultural setting in which the patient lives. Changes in role performance, such as lowered ability to keep or find a job, should not be used as criteria of dementia because of the large cross-cultural differences that exist in what is appropriate, and because there may be frequent, externally imposed changes in the availability of work within a particular culture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If depressive symptoms are present but the criteria for depressive episode (F32.0- F32.3) are not fulfilled, they can be recorded by means of a fifth character.

The impairment of memory typically affects the registration, storage, and retrieval of new information, but previously learned and familiar material may also be lost, particularly in the later stages. Dementia is more than dysmnesia: there is also impairment of thinking and of reasoning capacity, and a reduction in the flow of ideas. The processing of incoming information is impaired, in that the individual finds it increasingly difficult to attend to more than one stimulus at a time, such as taking part in a conversation with several persons, and to shift the focus of attention from one topic to another. If dementia is the sole diagnosis, evidence of clear consciousness is</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">required. However, a double diagnosis of delirium superimposed upon dementia is common (F05.1).

It is usually insidious in onset and develops slowly but steadily over a period of years. This period can be as short as 2 or 3 years, but can occasionally be considerably longer. The onset can be in middle adult life or even earlier (Alzheimer&#39;s disease with early onset), but the incidence is higher in later life (Alzheimer&#39;s disease with late onset). In cases with onset before the age of 65-70, there is the likelihood of a family history of a similar dementia, a more rapid course, and prominence of features of temporal and parietal lobe damage, including dysphasia or dyspraxia. In cases with a later onset, the course tends to be slower and to be characterized by more general impairment of higher cortical functions. Patients with Down&#39;s syndrome are at high risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are characteristic changes in the brain: a marked reduction in the population of neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, substantia innominata, locus ceruleus, and temporoparietal and frontal cortex; appearance of neurofibrillary tangles made of paired helical filaments; neuritic (argentophil) plaques, which consist largely of amyloid and show a definite progression in their development (although plaques without amyloid are also known to exist); and granulovacuolar bodies. Neurochemical changes have also been found, including a marked reduction in the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, in acetylcholine itself, and in other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As originally described, the clinical features are accompanied by the above brain changes. However. it now appears that the two do not always progress in parallel: one may be indisputably present with only minimal evidence of the other. Nevertheless, the clinical features of Alzheimer&#39;s disease are such that it is often possible to make a presumptive diagnosis on clinical grounds alone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dementia in Alzheimer&#39;s disease is at present irreversible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following features are essential for a definite diagnosis:</p><ol id="l22"><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><p class="s1" style="display: inline;">Presence of a dementia as described above.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -28pt;text-align: justify;"><p class="s1" style="display: inline;">Insidious onset with slow deterioration.

Typically, there is a history of transient ischaemic attacks with brief impairment of consciousness, fleeting pareses, or visual loss. The dementia may also follow a succession of acute cerebrovascular accidents or, less commonly, a single major stroke. Some impairment of memory and thinking then becomes apparent. Onset, which is usually in later life, can be abrupt, following one particular ischaemic episode, or there may be more gradual emergence. The dementia is usually the result of infarction of the brain due to vascular diseases, including hypertensive cerebrovascular disease. The infarcts are usually small but cumulative in their effect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The diagnosis presupposes the presence of a dementia as described above. Impairment of cognitive function is commonly uneven, so that there may be memory loss, intellectual impairment, and focal neurological signs. Insight and judgement may be relatively well preserved. An abrupt onset or a stepwise deterioration, as well as the presence of focal neurological signs and symptoms, increases the probability of the diagnosis; in some cases, confirmation can be provided only by computerized axial tomography or, ultimately, neuropathological examination.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Associated features are: hypertension, carotid bruit, emotional lability with transient depressive mood, weeping or explosive laughter, and transient episodes of clouded consciousness or delirium, often provoked by further infarction.

These symptoms may be accompanied by feelings of depression or anxiety, resulting from some loss of self-esteem and fear of permanent brain damage. Such feelings enhance the original symptoms and a vicious circle results. Some patients become hypochondriacal, embark on a search for diagnosis and cure, and may adopt a permanent sick role. The etiology of these symptoms is not always clear, and both organic and psychological factors have been proposed to account for them. The nosological status of this condition is thus somewhat uncertain.

class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This block contains a wide variety of disorders that differ in severity (from uncomplicated intoxication and harmful use to obvious psychotic disorders and dementia), but that are all attributable to the use of one or more psychoactive substances (which may or may not have been medically prescribed).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The substance involved is indicated by means of the second and third characters (i.e. the first two digits after the letter F), and the fourth and fifth characters specify the clinical states. To save space, all the psychoactive substances are listed first, followed by the four-character codes; these should be used, as required, for each substance specified, but it should be noted that not all four-character codes are applicable to all substances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Identification of the psychoactive substance used may be made on the basis of self-report data, objective analysis of specimens of urine, blood, etc., or other evidence (presence of drug samples in the patient&#39;s possession, clinical signs and symptoms, or reports from informed third parties). It is always advisable to seek corroboration from more than one source of evidence relating to substance use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Objective analyses provide the most compelling evidence of present or recent use, though these data have limitations with regard to past use and current levels of use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many drug users take more than one type of drug, but the diagnosis of the disorder should be classified, whenever possible, according to the most important single substance (or class of substances) used. This may usually be done with regard to the particular drug, or type of drug, causing the presenting disorder. When in doubt, code the drug or type of drug most frequently misused, particularly in those cases involving continuous or daily use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Only in cases in which patterns of psychoactive substance taking are chaotic and indiscriminate, or in which the contributions of different drugs are inextricably mixed, should code F19.- be used (disorders resulting from multiple drug use).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Misuse of other than psychoactive substances, such as laxatives or aspirin, should be coded by means of F55.- (abuse of non-dependence-producing substances), with a fourth character to specify the type of substance involved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cases in which mental disorders (particularly delirium in the elderly) are due to psychoactive substances, but without the presence of one of the disorders in this block (e.g. harmful use or dependence syndrome), should be coded in F00-F09. Where a state of delirium is superimposed upon such a disorder in this block, it should be coded by means of F1<i>x.</i>3 or F1<i>x.</i>4.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The level of alcohol involvement can be indicated by means of a supplementary code from Chapter XX of ICD-10: Y90.- (evidence of alcohol involvement determined by blood alcohol content) or Y91.- (evidence of alcohol involvement determined by level of intoxication).</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F1<span class="s4">x</span>.0Acute intoxication</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -46pt;text-align: justify;">A transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behaviour, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -46pt;text-align: justify;">This should be a main diagnosis only in cases where intoxication occurs without more persistent alcohol- or drug-related problems being concomitantly present. Where there are such problems, precedence should be given to diagnoses of harmful use (F1<i>x</i>.1), dependence syndrome (F1<i>x.</i>2), or psychotic disorder (F1<i>x.5).</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -46pt;text-align: justify;">Acute intoxication is usually closely related to dose levels (see ICD-10, Chapter XX). Exceptions to this may occur in individuals with certain underlying organic conditions (e.g. renal or hepatic insufficiency) in whom small doses of a substance may produce a disproportionately severe intoxicating effect. Disinhibition due to social context should also be taken into account (e.g. behavioural disinhibition at parties or carnivals). Acute intoxication is a transient phenomenon. Intensity of intoxication lessens with time, and effects eventually disappear in the absence of further use of the substance. Recovery is therefore complete except where tissue damage or another complication has arisen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -46pt;text-align: justify;">Symptoms of intoxication need not always reflect primary actions of the substance: for instance, depressant drugs may lead to symptoms of agitation or hyperactivity, and stimulant drugs may lead to socially withdrawn and introverted behaviour. Effects of substances such as cannabis and hallucinogens may be particularly unpredictable. Moreover, many psychoactive substances are capable of producing different types of effect at different dose levels. For example, alcohol may have apparently stimu- lant effects on behaviour at lower dose levels, lead to agitation and aggression with increasing dose levels, and produce clear sedation at very high levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="s1">: acute drunkenness in alcoholism &quot;bad trips&quot; (due to hallucinogenic drugs) drunkenness NOS</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -46pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis<span class="s1">.

class="s12" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Schizophrenia is the commonest and most important disorder of this group. Schizotypal disorder possesses many of the characteristic features of schizophrenic disorders and is probably genetically related to them; however, the hallucinations, delusions, and gross behavioural disturbances of schizophrenia itself are absent and so this disorder does not always come to medical attention. Most of the delusional disorders are probably unrelated to schizophrenia, although they may be difficult to distinguish clinically, particularly in their early stages. They form a heterogeneous and poorly understood collection of disorders, which can conveniently be divided according to their typical duration into a group of persistent delusional disorders and a larger group of acute and transient psychotic disorders. The latter appear to be particularly common in developing countries. The subdivisions listed here should be regarded as provisional. Schizoaffective disorders have been retained in this section in spite of their controversial nature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">F20 Schizophrenia</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The schizophrenic disorders are characterized in general by fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and by inappropriate or blunted affect. Clear consciousness and intellectual capacity are usually maintained, although certain cognitive deficits may evolve in the course of time. The disturbance involves the most basic functions that give the normal person a feeling of individuality, uniqueness, and self-direction. The most intimate thoughts, feelings, and acts are often felt to be known to or shared by others, and explanatory delusions may develop, to the effect that natural or supernatural forces are at work to influence the afflicted individual&#39;s thoughts and actions in ways that are often bizarre. The individual may see himself or herself as the pivot of all that happens. Hallucinations, especially auditory, are common and may comment on the individual&#39;s behaviour or thoughts. Perception is frequently disturbed in other ways: colours or sounds may seem unduly vivid or altered in quality, and irrelevant features of ordinary things may appear more important than the whole object or situation. Perplexity is also common early on and frequently leads to a belief that everyday situations possess a special, usually sinister, meaning intended uniquely for the individual. In the characteristic schizo- phrenic disturbance of thinking, peripheral and irrelevant features of a total concept, which are inhibited in normal directed mental activity, are brought to the fore and utilized in place of those that are relevant and appropriate to the situation. Thus thinking becomes vague, elliptical, and obscure, and its expression in speech sometimes incomprehensible. Breaks and interpolations in the train of thought are frequent, and thoughts may seem to be withdrawn by some outside agency. Mood is characteristically shallow, capricious, or incongruous. Ambivalence and disturbance of volition may appear as inertia, negativism, or stupor. Catatonia may be present. The onset may be acute, with seriously disturbed behaviour, or insidious, with a gradual development of odd ideas and conduct. The course of the disorder shows equally great variation and is by no means inevitably chronic or deteriorating (the course is specified by five-character categories). In a proportion of cases, which may vary in different cultures and populations, the outcome is complete, or nearly complete, recovery. The sexes are approximately equally affected but the onset tends to be later in women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although no strictly pathognomonic symptoms can be identified, for practical purposes it is useful to divide the above symptoms into groups that have special importance for the diagnosis and often occur together, such as:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l29"><li style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">thought echo, thought insertion or withdrawal, and thought broadcasting; (b)delusions of control, influence, or passivity, clearly referred to body or limb movements or</p></li></ol></li></ol><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">specific thoughts, actions, or sensations; delusional perception;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">(c)hallucinatory voices giving a running commentary on the patient&#39;s behaviour, or discussing the patient among themselves, or other types of hallucinatory voices coming from some part of the body;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">(d)persistent delusions of other kinds that are culturally inappropriate and completely impossible, such as religious or political identity, or superhuman powers and</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">abilities (e.g. being able to control the weather, or being in communication with aliens from another world);</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">(e)persistent hallucinations in any modality, when accompanied either by fleeting or half-formed delusions without clear affective content, or by persistent over-valued ideas, or when occurring every day for weeks or months on end;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">(f)breaks or interpolations in the train of thought, resulting in incoherence or irrelevant speech, or neologisms;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">(g)catatonic behaviour, such as excitement, posturing, or waxy flexibility, negativism, mutism, and stupor;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">(h)&quot;negative&quot; symptoms such as marked apathy, paucity of speech, and blunting or incongruity of emotional responses, usually resulting in social withdrawal and lowering of social performance; it must be clear that these are not due to depression or to neuroleptic medication;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: justify;">(i)a significant and consistent change in the overall quality of some aspects of personal behaviour, manifest as loss of interest, aimlessness, idleness, a self-absorbed attitude, and social withdrawal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The normal requirement for a diagnosis of schizophrenia is that a minimum of one very clear symptom (and usually two or more if less clear-cut) belonging to any one of the groups listed as (a) to (d) above, or symptoms from at least two of the groups referred to as (e) to (h), should have been clearly present for most of the time <span class="s15">during a period of 1 month or more. </span>Conditions meeting such symptomatic requirements but of duration less than 1 month (whether treated or not) should be diagnosed in the first instance as acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder (F23.2) and reclassified as schizophrenia if the symptoms persist for longer periods. Symptom (i) in the above list applies only to the diagnosis of Simple Schizophrenia (F20.6), and a duration of at least <u>one year</u> is required.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Viewed retrospectively, it may be clear that a prodromal phase in which symptoms and behaviour, such as loss of interest in work, social activities, and personal appearance and hygiene, together with generalized anxiety and mild degrees of depression and preoccupation, preceded the onset of psychotic symptoms by weeks or even months. Because of the difficulty in timing onset, the 1-month duration criterion applies only to the specific symptoms listed above and not to any prodromal nonpsychotic phase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The diagnosis of schizophrenia should not be made in the presence of extensive depressive or manic symptoms unless it is clear that schizophrenic symptoms antedated the affective disturbance. If both schizophrenic and affective symptoms develop together and are evenly balanced, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (F25.-) should be made, even if the schizophrenic symptoms by themselves would have justified the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia should not be diagnosed in the presence of overt brain disease or during states of drug intoxication or withdrawal. Similar disorders developing in the presence of epilepsy or other brain disease should be coded under F06.2 and those induced by drugs under F1<span class="s15">x</span>.5.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pattern of course</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The course of schizophrenic disorders can be classified by using the following five-character codes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">F20.<span class="s15">x</span>0 Continuous</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F20.<span class="s15">x</span>1 Episodic with progressive deficit F20.<span class="s15">x</span>2 Episodic with stable deficit F20.<span class="s15">x</span>3 Episodic remittent</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F20.<span class="s15">x</span>4 Incomplete remission F20.<span class="s15">x</span>5 Complete remission F20.<span class="s15">x</span>8 Other</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">F20.<span class="s15">x</span>9 Course uncertain, period of observation too short</p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F20.0 Paranoid schizophrenia</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is the commonest type of schizophrenia in most parts of the world. The clinical picture is dominated by relatively stable, often paranoid, delusions, usually accompanied by hallucinations, particularly of the auditory variety, and perceptual disturbances. Disturbances of affect, volition, and speech, and catatonic symptoms, are not prominent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Examples of the most common paranoid symptoms are:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: left;">(a)delusions of persecution, reference, exalted birth, special mission, bodily change, or jealousy;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: left;">(b)hallucinatory voices that threaten the patient or give commands, or auditory hallucinations without verbal form, such as whistling, humming, or laughing;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: left;">(c)hallucinations of smell or taste, or of sexual or other bodily sensations; visual hallucinations may occur but are rarely predominant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Thought disorder may be obvious in acute states, but if so it does not prevent the typical delusions or hallucinations from being described clearly. Affect is usually less blunted than in other varieties of schizophrenia, but a minor degree of incongruity is common, as are mood disturbances such as irritability, sudden anger, fearfulness, and suspicion. &quot;Negative&quot; symptoms such as blunting of affect and impaired volition are often present but do not dominate the clinical picture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The course of paranoid schizophrenia may be episodic, with partial or complete remissions, or chronic. In chronic cases, the florid symptoms persist over years and it is difficult to distinguish discrete episodes. The onset tends to be later than in the hebephrenic and catatonic forms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The general criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia (see introduction to F20 above) must be satisfied.  In addition, hallucinations and/or delusions must be prominent, and disturbances of affect, volition and speech, and catatonic symptoms must be relatively inconspicuous.  The hallucinations will usually be of the kind described in (b) and (c) above.  Delusions can be of almost any kind but delusions of control, influence, or passivity, and persecutory beliefs of various kinds are the most characteristic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Includes<span class="s12">: paraphrenic schizophrenia</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis<span class="s12">.

The mood is shallow and inappropriate and often accompanied by giggling or self-satisfied, self-absorbed smiling, or by a lofty manner, grimaces, mannerisms, pranks, hypochondriacal complaints, and reiterated phrases. Thought is disorganized and speech rambling and incoherent. There is a tendency to remain solitary, and behaviour seems empty of purpose and feeling. This form of schizophrenia usually starts between the ages of 15 and 25 years and tends to have a poor prognosis because of the rapid development of &quot;negative&quot; symptoms, particularly flattening of affect and loss of volition.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition, disturbances of affect and volition, and thought disorder are usually prominent. Hallucinations and delusions may be present but are not usually prominent. Drive and determination are lost and goals abandoned, so that the patient&#39;s behaviour becomes characteristically aimless and empty of purpose. A superficial and manneristic preoccupation with religion, philosophy, and other abstract themes may add to the listener&#39;s difficulty in following the train of thought.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The general criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia (see introduction to F20 above) must be satisfied. Hebephrenia should normally be diagnosed for the first time only in adolescents or young adults. The premorbid personality is characteristically, but not necessarily, rather shy and solitary. For a confident diagnosis of hebephrenia, a period of 2 or 3 months of continuous observation is usually necessary, in order to ensure that the characteristic behaviours described above are sustained.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Includes<span class="s12">: disorganized schizophrenia</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 159pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hebephrenia</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F20.2 Catatonic schizophrenia</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Prominent psychomotor disturbances are essential and dominant features and may alternate between extremes such as hyperkinesis and stupor, or automatic obedience and negativism. Constrained attitudes and postures may be maintained for long periods. Episodes of violent excitement may be a striking feature of the condition.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For reasons that are poorly understood, catatonic schizophrenia is now rarely seen in industrial countries, though it remains common elsewhere. These catatonic phenomena may be combined with a dream-like (oneiroid) state with vivid scenic hallucinations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The general criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia (see introduction to F20 above) must be satisfied. Transitory and isolated catatonic symptoms may occur in the context of any other subtype of schizophrenia, but for a diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia one or more of the following behaviours should dominate the clinical picture:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -54pt;text-align: left;">(a)stupor (marked decrease in reactivity to the environment and in spontaneous movements and activity) or mutism;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b)excitement (apparently purposeless motor activity, not influenced by external stimuli); (c)posturing (voluntary assumption and maintenance of inappropriate or bizarre postures); (d)negativism (an apparently motiveless resistance to all instructions or attempts to be moved,</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">or movement in the opposite direction);</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(e)rigidity (maintenance of a rigid posture against efforts to be moved);</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(f)waxy flexibility (maintenance of limbs and body in externally imposed positions); and (g)other symptoms such as command automatism (automatic compliance with instructions),</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">and perseveration of words and phrases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In uncommunicative patients with behavioural manifestations of catatonic disorder, the diagnosis of schizophrenia may have to be provisional until adequate evidence of the presence of other symptoms is obtained. It is also vital to appreciate that catatonic symptoms are not diagnostic of schizophrenia.

It is uncertain, and immaterial to the diagnosis, to what extent the depressive symptoms have merely been uncovered by the resolution of earlier psychotic symptoms (rather than being a new development) or are an intrinsic part of schizophrenia rather than a psychological reaction to it. They are rarely sufficiently severe or extensive to meet criteria for a severe depressive episode (F32.2 and F32.3), and it is often difficult to decide which of the patient&#39;s symptoms are due to depression and which to neuroleptic medication or to the impaired volition and affective flattening of schizophrenia itself.

They are probably heterogeneous, and have uncertain relationships to schizophrenia. The relative importance of genetic factors, personality characteristics, and life circumstances in their genesis is uncertain and probably variable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F22.0 Delusional disorder</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This group of disorders is characterized by the development either of a single delusion or of a set of related delusions which are usually persistent and sometimes lifelong. The delusions</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are highly variable in content. Often they are persecutory, hypochondriacal, or grandiose, but they may be concerned with litigation or jealousy, or express a conviction that the individual&#39;s body is misshapen, or that others think that he or she smells or is homosexual. Other psychopathology is characteristically absent, but depressive symptoms may be present intermittently, and olfactory and tactile hallucinations may develop in some cases. Clear and persistent auditory hallucinations (voices), schizophrenic symptoms such as delusions of control and marked blunting of affect, and definite evidence of brain disease are all incompatible with this diagnosis. However, occasional or transitory auditory hallucinations, particularly in elderly patients, do not rule out this diagnosis, provided that they are not typically schizophrenic and form only a small part of the overall clinical picture. Onset is commonly in middle age but sometimes, particularly in the case of beliefs about having a misshapen body, in early adult life. The content of the delusion, and the timing of its emergence, can often be related to the individual&#39;s life situation, e.g. persecutory delusions in members of minorities. Apart from actions and attitudes directly related to the delusion or delusional system, affect, speech, and behaviour are normal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Delusions constitute the most conspicuous or the only clinical characteristic.

Depressive symptoms or even a full-blown depressive episode (F32.-) may be present intermittently, provided that the delusions persist at times when there is no disturbance of mood.

There is some evidence that acute onset is associated with a good outcome, and it may be that the more abrupt the onset, the better the outcome. It is therefore recommended that, whenever appropriate, <span class="s15">abrupt onset </span>(within 48 hours or less) be specified.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <span class="s15">typical syndromes </span>that have been selected are first, the rapidly changing and variable state, called here &quot;polymorphic&quot;, that has been given prominence in acute psychotic states in several countries, and second, the presence of typical schizophrenic symptoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Associated acute stress <span class="s12">can also be specified, with a fifth character if desired, in view of its traditional linkage with acute psychosis. The limited evidence available, however, indicates that a substantial proportion of acute psychotic disorders arise without associated stress, and provision has therefore been made for the presence or the absence of stress to be recorded. Associated acute stress is taken to mean that the first psychotic symptoms occur within about 2 weeks of one or more events that would be regarded as stressful to most people in similar circumstances, within the culture of the person concerned. Typical events would be bereavement, unexpected loss of partner or job, marriage, or the psychological trauma of combat, terrorism, and torture. Long-standing difficulties or problems should not be included as a source of stress in this context.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Complete recovery usually occurs within 2 to 3 months, often within a few weeks or even days, and only a small proportion of patients with these disorders develop persistent and disabling states. Unfortunately, the present state of knowledge does not allow the early prediction of that small proportion of patients who will not recover rapidly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines are written on the assumption that they will be used by clinicians who may need to make a diagnosis when having to assess and treat patients within a few days or weeks of the onset of the disorder, not knowing how long the disorder will last. A number of reminders about the time limits and transition from one disorder to another have therefore been included, so as to alert those recording the diagnosis to the need to keep them up to date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The nomenclature of these acute disorders is as uncertain as their nosological status, but an attempt has been made to use simple and familiar terms. &quot;Psychotic disorder&quot; is used as a term of convenience for all the members of this group (psychotic is defined in the general introduction, page 3) with an additional qualifying term indicating the major defining feature of each separate type as it appears in the sequence noted above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">None of the disorders in the group satisfies the criteria for either manic (F30.-) or depressive (F32.-) episodes, although emotional changes and individual affective symptoms may be prominent from time to time.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These disorders are also defined by the absence of organic causation, such as states of concussion, delirium, or dementia. Perplexity, preoccupation, and inattention to the immediate conversation are often present, but if they are so marked or persistent as to suggest delirium or dementia of organic cause, the diagnosis should be delayed until investigation or observation has clarified this point. Similarly, disorders in F23.- should not be diagnosed in the presence of obvious intoxication by drugs or alcohol. However, a recent minor increase in the consumption of, for instance, alcohol or marijuana, with no evidence of severe intoxication or disorientation, should not rule out the diagnosis of one of these acute psychotic disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is important to note that the 48-hour and the 2-week criteria are not put forward as the times of maximum severity and disturbance, but as times by which the psychotic symptoms have become obvious and disruptive of at least some aspects of daily life and work. The peak disturbance may be reached later in both instances; the symptoms and disturbance have only to be obvious by the stated times, in the sense that they will usually have brought the patient into contact with some form of helping or medical agency. Prodromal periods of anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, or mildly abnormal behaviour do not qualify for inclusion in these periods of time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A fifth character may be used to indicate whether or nor the acute psychotic disorder is associated with acute stress:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 197%;text-align: left;">F23.<span class="s15">x</span>0 Without associated acute stress F23.<span class="s15">x</span>1 With associated acute stress</p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F23.0 Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An acute psychotic disorder in which hallucinations, delusions, and perceptual disturbances are obvious but markedly variable, changing from day to day or even from hour to hour.

This polymorphic and unstable, changing clinical picture is characteristic, and even though individual affective or psychotic symptoms may at times be present, the criteria for manic episode (F30.-), depressive episode (F32.-), or schizophrenia (F20.-) are not fulfilled.

Their relationship to typical mood [affective] disorders (F30-F39) and to schizophrenic disorders (F20-F24) is uncertain. They are given a separate category because they are too common to be ignored. Other conditions in which affective symptoms are superimposed upon or form part of a pre-existing schizophrenic illness, or in which they coexist or alternate with other types of persistent delusional disorders, are classified under the appropriate category in F20-F29. Mood-incongruent delusions or hallucinations in affective disorders (F30.2, F31.2, F31.5, F32.3, or F33.3) do not by themselves justify a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Patients who suffer from recurrent schizoaffective episodes, particularly those whose symptoms are of the manic rather than the depressive type, usually make a full recovery and only rarely develop a defect state.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be made only when <span class="s15">both </span>definite schizophrenic and definite affective symptoms are prominent <span class="s15">simultaneously</span>, or within a few days of each other, within the same episode of illness, and when, as a consequence of this, the episode of illness does not meet criteria for either schizophrenia or a depressive or manic episode. The term should not be applied to patients who exhibit schizophrenic symptoms and affective symptoms only in different episodes of illness. It is common, for example, for a schizophrenic patient to present with depressive symptoms in the aftermath of a psychotic episode (see post-schizophrenic depression (F20.4)). Some patients have recurrent schizoaffective episodes, which may be of the manic or depressive type or a mixture of the two. Others have one or two schizoaffective episodes interspersed between typical episodes of mania or depression. In the former case, schizoaffective disorder is the appropriate diagnosis. In the latter, the occurrence of an occasional schizoaffective episode does not invalidate a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder or recurrent depressive disorder if the clinical picture is typical in other respects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F25.0 Schizoaffective disorder, manic type</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A disorder in which schizophrenic and manic symptoms are both prominent in the same episode of illness. The abnormality of mood usually takes the form of elation, accompanied by increased self-esteem and grandiose ideas, but sometimes excitement or irritability are more obvious and accompanied by aggressive behaviour and persecutory ideas. In both cases there is increased energy, overactivity, impaired concentration, and a loss of normal social inhibition. Delusions of reference, grandeur, or persecution may be present, but other more typically schizophrenic symptoms are required to establish the diagnosis. People may insist, for example, that their thoughts are being broadcast or interfered with, or that alien forces are trying to control them, or they may report hearing voices of varied kinds or express bizarre delusional ideas that are not merely grandiose or persecutory. Careful questioning is often required to establish that an individual really is experiencing these morbid phenomena, and not merely joking or talking in metaphors. Schizoaffective disorders, manic type, are usually florid psychoses with an acute onset; although behaviour is often grossly disturbed, full recovery generally occurs within a few weeks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There must be a prominent elevation of mood, or a less obvious elevation of mood combined with increased irritability or excitement.

At the same time, or within the same episode, other more typically schizophrenic symptoms are present; patients may insist, for example, that their thoughts are being broadcast or interfered with, or that alien forces are trying to control them. They may be convinced that they are being spied upon or plotted against and this is not justified by their own behaviour. Voices may be heard that are not merely disparaging or condemnatory but that talk of killing the patient or discuss this behaviour between themselves.

justify;">Introduction</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The relationship between etiology, symptoms, underlying biochemical processes, response to treatment, and outcome of mood [affective] disorders is not yet sufficiently well understood to allow their classification in a way that is likely to meet with universal approval. Nevertheless, a classification must be attempted, and that presented here is put forward in the hope that it will at least be acceptable, since it is the result of widespread consultation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In these disorders, the fundamental disturbance is a change in mood or affect, usually to depression (with or without associated anxiety) or to elation. This mood change is normally accompanied by a change in the overall level of activity, and most other symptoms are either secondary to, or easily understood in the context of, such changes. Most of these disorders tend to be recurrent, and the onset of individual episodes is often related to stressful events or situations. This block deals with mood disorders in all age groups; those arising in childhood and adolescence should therefore be coded here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main criteria by which the affective disorders have been classified have been chosen for practical reasons, in that they allow common clinical disorders to be easily identified. Single episodes have been distinguished from bipolar and other multiple episode disorders because substantial proportions of patients have only one episode of illness, and severity is given prominence because of implications for treatment and for provision of different levels of service. It is acknowledged that the symptoms referred to here as &quot;somatic&quot; could also have been called &quot;melancholic&quot;, &quot;vital&quot;, &quot;biological&quot;, or &quot;endogenomorphic&quot;, and that the scientific status of this syndrome is in any case somewhat questionable. It is to be hoped that the result of its inclusion here will be widespread critical appraisal of the usefulness of its separate identification. The classification is arranged so that this somatic syndrome can be recorded by those who so wish, but can also be ignored without loss of any other information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Distinguishing between different grades of severity remains a problem; the three grades of mild, moderate, and severe have been specified here because many clinicians wish to have them available.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The terms &quot;mania&quot; and &quot;severe depression&quot; are used in this classification to denote the opposite ends of the affective spectrum; &quot;hypomania&quot; is used to denote an intermediate state without delusions, hallucinations, or complete disruption of normal activities, which is often (but not exclusively) seen as patients develop or recover from mania.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">F30 Manic episode</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Three degrees of severity are specified here, sharing the common underlying characteristics of elevated mood, and an increase in the quantity and speed of physical and mental activity. All the subdivisions of this category should be used only for a single manic episode. If previous or subsequent affective episodes (depressive, manic, or hypomanic), the disorder should be coded under bipolar affective disorder (F31.-).</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Includes: <span class="p">bipolar disorder, single manic episode</span></p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F30.0 Hypomania</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Hypomania is a lesser degree of mania (F30.1), in which abnormalities of mood and behaviour are too persistent and marked to be included under cyclothymia (F34.0) but are not accompanied by hallucinations or delusions. There is a persistent mild elevation of mood (for at least several days on end), increased energy and activity, and usually marked feelings of well-being and both physical and mental efficiency. Increased sociability, talkativeness, overfamiliarity, increased sexual energy, and a decreased need for sleep are often present but not to the extent that they lead to severe disruption of work or result in social rejection. Irritability, conceit, and boorish behaviour may take the place of the more usual euphoric sociability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Concentration and attention may be impaired, thus diminishing the ability to settle down to work or to relaxation and leisure, but this may not prevent the appearance of interests in quite new ventures and activities, or mild over-spending.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Several of the features mentioned above, consistent with elevated or changed mood and increased activity, should be present for at least several days on end, to a degree and with a persistence greater than described for cyclothymia (F34.0). Considerable interference with work or social activity is consistent with a diagnosis of hypomania, but if disruption of these is severe or complete, mania (F30.1 or F30.2) should be diagnosed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis<span class="p">. Hypomania covers the range of disorders of mood and level of activities between cyclothymia (F34.0) and mania (F30.1 and F30.2). The increased activity and restlessness (and often weight loss) must be distinguished from the same symptoms occurring in hyperthyroidism and anorexia nervosa; early states of &quot;agitated depression&quot;, particularly in late middle age, may bear a superficial resemblance to hypomania of the irritable variety. Patients with severe obsessional symptoms may be active part of the night completing their domestic cleaning rituals, but their affect will usually be the opposite of that described here.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">When a short period of hypomania occurs as a prelude to or aftermath of mania (F30.1 and F30.2), it is usually not worth specifying the hypomania separately.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F30.1 Mania without psychotic symptoms</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Mood is elevated out of keeping with the individual&#39;s circumstances and may vary from carefree joviality to almost uncontrollable excitement. Elation is accompanied by increased energy, resulting in overactivity, pressure of speech, and a decreased need for sleep. Normal social inhibitions are lost, attention cannot be sustained, and there is often marked distractability. Self-esteem is inflated, and grandiose or over-optimistic ideas are freely expressed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Perceptual disorders may occur, such as the appreciation of colours as especially vivid (and usually beautiful), a preoccupation with fine details of surfaces or textures, and subjective hyperacusis. The individual may embark on extravagant and impractical schemes, spend money recklessly, or become aggressive, amorous, or facetious in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">inappropriate circumstances. In some manic episodes the mood is irritable and suspicious rather than elated. The first attack occurs most commonly between the ages of 15 and 30 years, but may occur at any age from late childhood to the seventh or eighth decade.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The episode should last for at least 1 week and should be severe enough to disrupt ordinary work and social activities more or less completely. The mood change should be accompanied by increased energy and several of the symptoms referred to above (particularly pressure of speech, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, and excessive optimism).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F30.2 Mania with psychotic symptoms</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The clinical picture is that of a more severe form of mania as described in F30.1.Inflated self-esteem and grandiose ideas may develop into delusions, and irritability and suspiciousness into delusions of persecution. In severe cases, grandiose or religious delusions of identity or role may be prominent, and flight of ideas and pressure of speech may result in the individual becoming incomprehensible. Severe and sustained physical activity and excitement may result in aggression or violence, and neglect of eating, drinking, and personal hygiene may result in dangerous states of dehydration and self-neglect. If required, delusions or hallucinations can be specified as congruent or incongruent with the mood. &quot;Incongruent&quot; should be taken as including affectively neutral delusions and hallucinations; for example, delusions of reference with no guilty or accusatory content, or voices speaking to the individual about events that have no special emotional significance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">One of the commonest problems is differentiation of this disorder from schizophrenia, particularly if the stages of development through hypomania have been missed and the patient is seen only at the height of the illness when widespread delusions, incomprehensible speech, and violent excitement may obscure the basic disturbance of affect. Patients with mania that is responding to neuroleptic medication may present a similar diagnostic problem at the stage when they have returned to normal levels of physical and mental activity but still have delusions or hallucinations. Occasional hallucinations or delusions as specified for schizophrenia (F20.-) may also be classed as mood-incongruent, but if these symptoms are prominent and persistent, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (F25.-) is more likely to be appropriate (see also page ??).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">manic stupor</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F30.8 Other manic episodes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F30.9 Manic episode, unspecified</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">mania NOS</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F31 Bipolar affective disorder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This disorder is characterized by repeated (i.e. at least two) episodes in which the patient&#39;s mood and activity levels are significantly disturbed, this disturbance consisting on some occasions of an elevation of mood and increased energy and activity (mania or hypomania), and on others of a lowering of mood and decreased energy and activity (depression). Characteristically, recovery is usually complete between episodes, and the incidence in the two sexes is more nearly equal than in other mood disorders. As patients who suffer only from repeated episodes of mania are comparatively rare, and resemble (in their family history, premorbid personality, age of onset, and long-term prognosis) those who also have at least occasional episodes of depression, such patients are classified as bipolar (F31.8).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Manic episodes usually begin abruptly and last for between 2 weeks and 4-5 months (median duration about 4 months). Depressions tend to last longer (median length about 6 months), though rarely for more than a year, except in the elderly. Episodes of both kinds often follow stressful life events or other mental trauma, but the presence of such stress is not essential for the diagnosis. The first episode may occur at any age from childhood to old age. The frequency of episodes and the pattern of remissions and relapses are both very variable, though remissions tend to get shorter as time goes on and depressions to become commoner and longer lasting after middle age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Although the original concept of &quot;manic-depressive psychosis&quot; also included patients who suffered only from depression, the term &quot;manic-depressive disorder or psychosis&quot; is now used mainly as a synonym for bipolar disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">manic-depressive illness, psychosis or reaction</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes:<span class="p">bipolar disorder, single manic episode (F30.-)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cyclothymia (F34.0)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F31.0 Bipolar affective disorder, current episode hypomanic</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a)the current episode must fulfil the criteria for hypomania (F30.0);

Depressive symptoms and symptoms of hypomania or mania may also alternate rapidly, from day to day or even from hour to hour. A diagnosis of mixed bipolar affective disorder should be made only if the two sets of symptoms are both prominent for the greater part of the current episode of illness, and if that episode has lasted for at least 2 weeks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">single mixed affective episode (F38.0)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F31.7 Bipolar affective disorder, currently in remission</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The patient has had at least one manic, hypomanic, or mixed affective episode in the past and in addition at least one other affective episode of hypomanic, manic, depressive, or mixed type, but is not currently suffering from any significant mood disturbance, and has not done so for several months.

Marked tiredness after only slight effort is common. Other common symptoms are:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a)reduced concentration and attention; (b)reduced self-esteem and self-confidence;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c)ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode); (d)bleak and pessimistic views of the future;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(e)ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide; (f)disturbed sleep</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(g)diminished appetite.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The lowered mood varies little from day to day, and is often unresponsive to circumstances, yet may show a characteristic diurnal variation as the day goes on. As with manic episodes, the clinical presentation shows marked individual variations, and atypical presentations are particularly common in adolescence. In some cases, anxiety, distress, and motor agitation may be more prominent at times than the depression, and the mood change may also be masked by added features such as irritability, excessive consumption of alcohol, histrionic behaviour, and exacerbation of pre-existing phobic or obsessional symptoms, or by hypochondriacal preoccupations. For depressive episodes of all three grades of severity, a duration of at least 2 weeks is usually required for diagnosis, but shorter periods may be reasonable if symptoms are unusually severe and of rapid onset.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Some of the above symptoms may be marked and develop characteristic features that are widely regarded as having special clinical significance. The most typical examples of these &quot;somatic&quot; symptoms (see introduction to this block, page 112 [of Blue Book]) are: loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are normally enjoyable; lack of emotional reactivity to normally pleasurable surroundings and events; waking in the morning 2 hours or more before the usual time; depression worse in the morning; objective evidence of definite psychomotor retardation or agitation (remarked on or reported by other people); marked loss of appetite; weight loss (often defined as 5% or more of body weight in the past month); marked loss of libido. Usually, this somatic syndrome is not regarded as present unless about four of these symptoms are definitely present.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The categories of mild (F32.0), moderate (F32.1) and severe (F32.2 and F32.3) depressive episodes described in more detail below should be used only for a single (first) depressive episode. Further depressive episodes should be classified under one of the subdivisions of recurrent depressive disorder (F33.-).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">These grades of severity are specified to cover a wide range of clinical states that are encountered in different types of psychiatric practice. Individuals with mild depressive episodes are common in primary care and general medical settings, whereas psychiatric inpatient units deal largely with patients suffering from the severe grades.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Acts of self-harm associated with mood [affective] disorders, most commonly self-poisoning by prescribed medication, should be recorded by means of an additional code from Chapter XX of ICD-10 (X60-X84). These codes do not involve differentiation between attempted suicide and &quot;parasuicide&quot;, since both are included in the general category of self-harm.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differentiation between mild, moderate, and severe depressive episodes rests upon a complicated clinical judgement that involves the number, type, and severity of symptoms present. The extent of ordinary social and work activities is often a useful general guide to the likely degree of severity of the episode, but individual, social, and cultural influences that disrupt a smooth relationship between severity of symptoms and social performance are sufficiently common and powerful to make it unwise to include social performance amongst the essential criteria of severity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The presence of dementia (F00-F03) or mental retardation (F70-F79) does not rule out the diagnosis of a treatable depressive episode, but communication difficulties are likely to make it necessary to rely more than usual for the diagnosis upon objectively observed somatic symptoms, such as psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and weight, and sleep disturbance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: -84pt;text-align: justify;">Includes: <span class="p">single episodes of depressive reaction, major depression (without psychotic symptoms), psychogenic depression or reactive depression (F32.0, F32.1 or F32.2)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F32.0 Mild depressive episode</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms of depression, and at least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms described on page 119 (for F32.-) should usually be present for a definite diagnosis.

Loss of self-esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in particularly severe cases. It is presumed here that the somatic syndrome will almost always be present in a severe depressive episode.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">All three of the typical symptoms noted for mild and moderate depressive episodes (F32.0, F32.1) should be present, plus at least four other symptoms, some of which should be of severe intensity. However, if important symptoms such as agitation or retardation are marked, the patient may be unwilling or unable to describe many symptoms in detail. An overall grading of severe episode may still be justified in such instances. The depressive episode should usually last at least 2 weeks, but if the symptoms are particularly severe and of very rapid onset, it may be justified to make this diagnosis after less than 2 weeks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">During a severe depressive episode it is very unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work, or domestic activities, except to a very limited extent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This category should be used only for single episodes of severe depression without psychotic symptoms; for further episodes, a subcategory of recurrent depressive disorder (F33.-) should be used.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">single episodes of agitated depression</span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">melancholia or vital depression without psychotic symptoms</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F32.3 Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">A severe depressive episode which meets the criteria given for F32.2 above and in which delusions, hallucinations, or depressive stupor are present.

The age of onset and the severity, duration, and frequency of the episodes of depression are all highly variable. In general, the first episode occurs later than in bipolar disorder, with a mean age of onset in the fifth decade. Individual episodes also last between 3 and 12 months (median duration about 6 months) but recur less frequently. Recovery is usually complete between episodes, but a minority of patients may develop a persistent depression, mainly in old age (for which this category should still be used).

Because they last for years at a time, and sometimes for the greater part of the individual&#39;s adult life, they involve considerable subjective distress and disability. In some instances, however, recurrent or single episodes of manic disorder, or mild or severe depressive disorder, may become superimposed on a persistent affective disorder. The persistent affective disorders are classified here rather than with the personality disorders because of evidence from family studies that they are genetically related to the mood disorders, and because they are sometimes amenable to the same treatments as mood disorders. Both early- and late- onset varieties of cyclothymia and dysthymia are described, and should be specified as such if required.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F34.0 Cyclothymia</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">A persistent instability of mood, involving numerous periods of mild depression and mild elation. This instability usually develops early in adult life and pursues a chronic course, although at times the mood may be normal and stable for months at a time. The mood swings are usually perceived by the individual as being unrelated to life events. The diagnosis is difficult to establish without a prolonged period of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">observation or an unusually good account of the individual&#39;s past behaviour. Because the mood swings are relatively mild and the periods of mood elevation may be enjoyable, cyclothymia frequently fails to come to medical attention. In some cases this may be because the mood change, although present, is less prominent than cyclical changes in activity, self-confidence, sociability, or appetitive behaviour. If required, age of onset may be specified as early (in late teenage or the twenties) or late.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The essential feature is a persistent instability of mood, involving numerous periods of mild depression and mild elation, none of which has been sufficiently severe or prolonged to fulfil the criteria for bipolar affective disorder (F31.-) or recurrent depressive disorder (F33.-). This implies that individual episodes of mood swings do not fulfil the criteria for any of the categories described under manic episode (F30.-) or depressive episode (F32.-).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes:<span class="p">affective personality disorder cycloid personality</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cyclothymic personality</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">This disorder is common in the relatives of patients with bipolar affective disorder (F31.-) and some individuals with cyclothymia eventually develop bipolar affective disorder themselves.

The balance between individual phases of mild depression and intervening periods of comparative normality is very variable. Sufferers usually have periods of days or weeks when they describe themselves as well, but most of the time (often for months at a time) they feel tired and depressed; everything is an effort and nothing is enjoyed. They brood and complain, sleep badly and feel inadequate, but are usually able to cope with the basic demands of everyday life. Dysthymia therefore has much in common with the concepts of depressive neurosis and neurotic depression. If required, age of onset may be specified as early (in late teenage or the twenties) or late.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The essential feature is a very long-standing depression of mood which is never, or only very rarely, severe enough to fulfil the criteria for recurrent depressive disorder, mild or moderate severity (F33.0 or F33.1).

stress-related, and somatoform disorders have been brought together in one large overall group because of their historical association with the concept of neurosis and the association of a substantial (though uncertain)proportion of these disorders with psychological causation. As noted in the general introduction to this classification, the concept of neurosis has not been retained as a major organizing principle, but care has been taken to allow the easy identification of disorders that some users still might wish to regard as neurotic in their own usage of the term (see note on neurosis in the general introduction (page 3).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mixtures of symptoms are common (coexistent depression and anxiety being by far the most frequent), particularly in the less severe varieties of these disorders often seen in primary care. Although efforts should be made to decide which is the predominant syndrome, a category is provided for those cases of mixed depression and anxiety in which it would be artificial to force a decision (F41.2).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">F40 Phobic anxiety disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">In this group of disorders, anxiety is evoked only, or predominantly, by certain well-defined situations or objects (external to the individual) which are not currently dangerous. As a result, these situations or objects are characteristically avoided or endured with dread. Phobic anxiety is indistinguishable subjectively, physiologically, and behaviourally from other types of anxiety and may vary in severity from mild unease to terror. The individual&#39;s concern may focus on individual symptoms such as palpitations or feeling faint and is often associated with secondary fears of dying, losing control, or going mad. The anxiety is not relieved by the knowledge that other people do not regard the situation in question as dangerous or threatening. Mere contemplation of entry to the phobic situation usually generates anticipatory anxiety.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The adoption of the criterion that the phobic object or situation is external to the subject implies that many of the fears relating to the presence of disease (nosophobia) and disfigurement (dysmorphobia) are now classified under F45.2 (hypochondriacal disorder). However, if the fear of disease arises predominantly and repeatedly from possible exposure to infection or contamination, or is simply a fear of medical procedures (injections, operations, etc.) or medical establishments (dentists&#39; surgeries, hospitals, etc.), a category from F40.- will be appropriate (usually F40.2, specific phobia).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Phobic anxiety often coexists with depression. Pre-existing phobic anxiety almost invariably gets worse during an intercurrent depressive episode. Some depressive episodes are accompanied by temporary phobic anxiety and a depressive mood often accompanies some phobias, particularly agoraphobia. Whether two diagnoses, phobic anxiety and depressive episode, are needed or only one is determined by whether one disorder developed clearly before the other and by whether one is clearly predominant at the time of diagnosis. If the criteria for depressive disorder were met before the phobic symptoms first appeared, the former should be given diagnostic precedence (see note in Introduction, pages 6 and 7).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most phobic disorders other than social phobias are more common in women than in men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">In this classification, a panic attack (F41.0) occurring in an established phobic situation is regarded as an expression of the severity of the phobia, which should be given diagnostic precedence. Panic disorder as a main diagnosis should be diagnosed only in the absence of any of the phobias listed in F40.-.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">F40.0 Agoraphobia</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The term &quot;agoraphobia&quot; is used here with a wider meaning than it had when originally introduced and as it is still used in some countries. It is now taken to include fears not only of open</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">spaces but also of related aspects such as the presence of crowds and the difficulty of immediate easy escape to a safe place (usually home). The term therefore refers to an interrelated and often overlapping cluster of phobias embracing fears of leaving home: fear of entering shops, crowds, and public places, or of travelling alone in trains, buses, or planes. Although the severity of the anxiety and the extent of avoidance behaviour are variable, this is the most incapacitating of the phobic disorders and some sufferers become completely housebound; many are terrified by the thought of collapsing and being left helpless in public. The lack of an immediately available exit is one of the key features of many of these agoraphobic situations. Most sufferers are women and the onset is usually early in adult life. Depressive and obsessional symptoms and social phobias may also be present but do not dominate the clinical picture. In the absence of effective treatment, agoraphobia often becomes chronic, though usually fluctuating.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of the following criteria should be fulfilled for a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">(a)the psychological or autonomic symptoms must be primarily manifestations of anxiety and not secondary to other symptoms, such as delusions or obsessional thoughts;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">(b)the anxiety must be restricted to (or occur mainly in) at least two of the following situations: crowds, public places, travelling away from home, and travelling alone; and</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c)avoidance of the phobic situation must be, or have been, a prominent feature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">It must be remembered that some agoraphobics experience little anxiety because they are consistently able to avoid their phobic situations. The presence of other symptoms such as depression, depersonalization, obsessional symptoms, and social phobias does not invalidate the diagnosis, provided that these symptoms do not dominate the clinical picture. However, if the patient was already significantly depressed when the phobic symptoms first appeared, depressive episode may be a more appropriate main diagnosis; this is more common in late-onset cases.</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The presence or absence of panic disorder (F41.0) in the agoraphobic situation on a majority of occasions may be recorded by means of a fifth character:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 33pt;line-height: 206%;text-align: left;">F40.00 Without panic disorder F40.01 With panic disorder</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">panic disorder with agoraphobia</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F40.1 Social phobias</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Social phobias often start in adolescence and are centred around a fear of scrutiny by other people in comparatively small groups (as opposed to crowds), usually leading to avoidance of social situations. Unlike most other phobias, social phobias are equally common in men and women. They may be discrete (i.e. restricted to eating in public, to public speaking, or to encounters with the opposite sex) or diffuse, involving almost all social situations outside the family circle. A fear of vomiting in public may be important. Direct eye-to-eye confrontation may be particularly stressful in some cultures. Social phobias are usually associated with low self-esteem and fear of criticism. They may present as a complaint of blushing, hand tremor, nausea, or urgency of micturition, the individual sometimes being convinced that one of these secondary manifestations of anxiety is the primary problem; symptoms may progress to panic attacks. Avoidance is often marked, and in extreme cases may result in almost complete social isolation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of the following criteria should be fulfilled for a definite diagnosis:</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: justify;">(a)the psychological, behavioural, or autonomic symptoms must be primarily manifestations of anxiety and not secondary to other symptoms such as delusions or obsessional thoughts;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b)the anxiety must be restricted to or predominate in particular social situations; and (c)the phobic situation is avoided whenever possible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -84pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">anthropophobia social neurosis</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">Agoraphobia and depressive disorders are often prominent, and may both contribute to sufferers becoming &quot;housebound&quot;. If the distinction between social phobia and agoraphobia is very difficult, precedence should be given to agoraphobia; a depressive diagnosis should not be made unless a full depressive syndrome can be identified clearly.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F40.2 Specific (isolated) phobias</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">These are phobias restricted to highly specific situations such as proximity to particular animals, heights, thunder, darkness, flying, closed spaces, urinating or defecating in public toilets, eating certain foods, dentistry, the sight of blood or injury, and the fear of exposure to specific diseases. Although the triggering situation is discrete, contact with it can evoke panic as in agoraphobia or social phobias. Specific phobias usually arise in childhood or early adult life and can persist for decades if they remain untreated. The seriousness of the resulting handicap depends on how easy it is for the sufferer to avoid the phobic situation. Fear of the phobic situation tends not to fluctuate, in contrast to agoraphobia. Radiation sickness and venereal infections and, more recently, AIDS are common subjects of disease phobias.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of the following should be fulfilled for a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: justify;">(a)the psychological or autonomic symptoms must be primary manifestations of anxiety, and not secondary to other symptoms such as delusion or obsessional thought;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b)the anxiety must be restricted to the presence of the particular phobic object or situation; and (c)the phobic situation is avoided whenever possible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="s12">: acrophobia</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">animal phobias claustrophobia examination phobia simple phobia</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">It is usual for there to be no other psychiatric symptoms, in contrast to agoraphobia and social phobias. Blood-injury phobias differ from others in leading to bradycardia and sometimes syncope, rather than tachycardia. Fears of specific diseases such as cancer, heart disease, or venereal infection should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder (F45.2), unless they relate to specific situations where the disease might be acquired. If the conviction of disease reaches delusional intensity, the diagnosis should be delusional disorder (F22.0). Individuals who are convinced that they have an abnormality or disfigurement of a specific bodily (often facial) part, which is not objectively noticed by others (sometimes termed dysmorphophobia), should be classified under hypochondriacal disorder (F45.2) or delusional disorder (F22.0), depending upon the strength and persistence of their conviction.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 209%;text-align: left;">F40.8 Other phobic anxiety disorders F40.9 Phobic anxiety disorder, unspecified</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">phobia NOS</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">phobic states NOS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F41 Other anxiety disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Manifestations of anxiety are the major symptoms of these disorders and are not restricted to any particular environmental situation.

As in other anxiety disorders, the dominant symptoms vary from person to person, but sudden onset of palpitations, chest pain, choking sensations, dizziness, and feelings of unreality (depersonalization or derealization) are common. There is also, almost invariably, a secondary fear of dying, losing control, or going mad. Individual attacks usually last for minutes only, though sometimes longer; their frequency and the course of the disorder are both rather variable. An individual in a panic attack often experiences a crescendo of fear and autonomic symptoms which results in an exit, usually hurried, from wherever he or she may be. If this occurs in a specific situation, such as on a bus or in a crowd, the patient may subsequently avoid that situation. Similarly, frequent and unpredictable panic attacks produce fear of being alone or going into public places. A panic attack is often followed by a persistent fear of having another attack.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">In this classification, a panic attack that occurs in an established phobic situation is regarded as an expression of the severity of the phobia, which should be given diagnostic precedence.

As in other anxiety disorders the dominant symptoms are highly variable, but complaints of continuous feelings of nervousness, trembling, muscular tension, sweating, lightheadedness, palpitations, dizziness, and epigastric discomfort are common. Fears that the sufferer or a relative will shortly become ill or have an accident are often expressed, together with a variety of other worries and forebodings. This disorder is more common in women, and often related to chronic environmental stress. Its course is variable but tends to be fluctuating and chronic.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The sufferer must have primary symptoms of anxiety most days for at least several weeks at a time, and usually for several months. These symptoms should usually involve elements of:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a)apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling &quot;on edge&quot;, difficulty in concentrating, etc.); (b)motor tension (restless fidgeting, tension headaches, trembling, inability to relax); and</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">(c)autonomic overactivity (lightheadedness, sweating, tachycardia or tachypnoea, epigastric discomfort, dizziness, dry mouth, etc.).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In children, frequent need for reassurance and recurrent somatic complaints may be prominent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The transient appearance (for a few days at a time) of other symptoms, particularly depression, does not rule out generalized anxiety disorder as a main diagnosis, but the sufferer must not meet the full criteria for depressive episode (F32.-), phobic anxiety disorder (F40.-), panic disorder (F41.0), or obsessive-compulsive disorder (F42.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -84pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">anxiety neurosis anxiety reaction anxiety state</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Excludes<span class="s12">:     neurasthenia (F48.0)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F41.2 Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This mixed category should be used when symptoms of both anxiety and depression are present, but neither set of symptoms, considered separately, is sufficiently severe to justify a diagnosis. If severe anxiety is present with a lesser degree of depression, one of the other categories for anxiety or phobic disorders should be used. When both depressive and anxiety syndromes are present and severe enough to justify individual diagnoses, both disorders should be recorded and this category should not be used; if, for practical reasons of recording, only one diagnosis can be made, depression should be given precedence. Some autonomic symptoms (tremor, palpitations, dry mouth, stomach churning, etc.) must be present, even if only intermittently; if only worry or over-concern is present, without autonomic symptoms, this category should not be used. If symptoms that fulfil the criteria for this disorder occur in close association with significant life changes or stressful life events, category F43.2, adjustment disorders, should be used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Individuals with this mixture of comparatively mild symptoms are frequently seen in primary care, but many more cases exist among the population at large which never come to medical or psychiatric attention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">anxiety depression (mild or not persistent)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="s12">: persistent anxiety depression (dysthymia) (F34.1)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F41.3 Other mixed anxiety disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This category should be used for disorders that meet the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and that also have prominent (although often short-lasting) features of other disorders in F40-F48, although the full criteria for these additional disorders are not met.

(For brevity, &quot;obsessional&quot; will be used subsequently in place of &quot;obsessive-compulsive&quot; when referring to symptoms.) Obsessional thoughts are ideas, images or impulses that enter the individual&#39;s mind again and again in a stereotyped form. They are almost invariably distressing (because they are violent or obscene, or simply because they are perceived as senseless) and the sufferer often tries, unsuccessfully, to resist them. They are, however, recognized as the individual&#39;s own thoughts, even though they are involuntary and often repugnant. Compulsive acts or rituals are stereotyped behaviours that are repeated again and again. They are not inherently enjoyable, nor do they result in the completion of inherently useful tasks. The individual often views them as preventing some objectively unlikely event, often involving harm to or caused by himself or herself. Usually, though not invariably, this behaviour is recognized by the individual as pointless or ineffectual and repeated attempts are made to resist it; in very long-standing cases, resistance may be minimal. Autonomic anxiety symptoms are often present, but distressing feelings of internal or psychic tension without obvious autonomic arousal are also common. There is a close relationship between obsessional symptoms, particularly obsessional thoughts, and depression. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often have depressive symptoms, and patients suffering from recurrent depressive disorder (F33.-) may develop obsessional thoughts during their episodes of depression. In either situation, increases or decreases in the severity of the depressive symptoms are generally accompanied by parallel changes in the severity of the obsessional symptoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Obsessive-compulsive disorder is equally common in men and women, and there are often prominent anankastic features in the underlying personality. Onset is usually in childhood or early adult life. The course is variable and more likely to be chronic in the absence of significant depressive symptoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">For a definite diagnosis, obsessional symptoms or compulsive acts, or both, must be present on most days for at least 2 successive weeks and be a source of distress or interference with activities. The obsessional symptoms should have the following characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a)they must be recognized as the individual&#39;s own thoughts or impulses;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">(b)there must be at least one thought or act that is still resisted unsuccessfully, even though others may be present which the sufferer no longer resists;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">(c)the thought of carrying out the act must not in itself be pleasurable (simple relief of tension or anxiety is not regarded as pleasure in this sense);</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(d)the thoughts, images, or impulses must be unpleasantly repetitive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -84pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="s12">: anankastic neurosis obsessional neurosis</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">obsessive-compulsive neurosis</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">Differentiating between obsessive-compulsive disorder and a depressive disorder may be difficult because these two types of symptoms so frequently occur together. In an acute episode of disorder, precedence should be given to the symptoms that developed</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">first; when both types are present but neither predominates, it is usually best to regard the depression as primary. In chronic disorders the symptoms that most frequently persist in the absence of the other should be given priority.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Occasional panic attacks or mild phobic symptoms are no bar to the diagnosis. However, obsessional symptoms developing in the presence of schizophrenia, Tourette&#39;s syndrome, or organic mental disorder should be regarded as part of these conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Although obsessional thoughts and compulsive acts commonly coexist, it is useful to be able to specify one set of symptoms as predominant in some individuals, since they may respond to different treatments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F42.0 Predominantly obsessional thoughts or ruminations</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">These may take the form of ideas, mental images, or impulses to act. They are very variable in content but nearly always distressing to the individual. A woman may be tormented, for example, by a fear that she might eventually be unable to resist an impulse to kill the child she loves, or by the obscene or blasphemous and ego-alien quality of a recurrent mental image. Sometimes the ideas are merely futile, involving an endless and quasi-philosophical consideration of imponderable alternatives. This indecisive consideration of alternatives is an important element in many other obsessional ruminations and is often associated with an inability to make trivial but necessary decisions in day-to-day living.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The relationship between obsessional ruminations and depression is particularly close: a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder should be preferred only if ruminations arise or persist in the absence of a depressive disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F42.1 Predominantly compulsive acts [obsessional rituals]</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The majority of compulsive acts are concerned with cleaning (particularly hand-washing), repeated checking to ensure that a potentially dangerous situation has not been allowed to develop, or orderliness and tidiness. Underlying the overt behaviour is a fear, usually of danger either to or caused by the patient, and the ritual act is an ineffectual or symbolic attempt to avert that danger. Compulsive ritual acts may occupy many hours every day and are sometimes associated with marked indecisiveness and slowness. Overall, they are equally common in the two sexes but hand-washing rituals are more common in women and slowness without repetition is more common in men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Compulsive ritual acts are less closely associated with depression than obsessional thoughts and are more readily amenable to behavioural therapies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F42.2 Mixed obsessional thoughts and acts</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Most obsessive-compulsive individuals have elements of both obsessional thinking and compulsive behaviour. This subcategory should be used if the two are equally prominent, as is often the case, but it is useful to specify only one if it is clearly predominant, since thoughts and acts may respond to different treatments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F42.8 Other obsessive-compulsive disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F42.9 Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F43 Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This category differs from others in that it includes disorders identifiable not only on grounds of symptomatology and course but also on the basis of one or other of two causative influences - an exceptionally stressful life event producing an acute stress reaction, or a significant life change leading to continued unpleasant circumstances that result in an adjustment disorder. Less severe psychosocial stress (&quot;life events&quot;) may precipitate the onset or contribute to the</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">presentation of a very wide range of disorders classified elsewhere in this work, but the etiological importance of such stress is not always clear and in each case will be found to depend on individual, often idiosyncratic, vulnerability. In other words, the stress is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the occurrence and form of the disorder. In contrast, the disorders brought together in this category are thought to arise always as a direct consequence of the acute severe stress or continued trauma. The stressful event or the continuing unpleasantness of circumstances is the primary and overriding causal factor, and the disorder would not have occurred without its impact. Reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders in all age groups, including children and adolescents, are included in this category.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Although each individual symptom of which both the acute stress reaction and the adjustment disorder are composed may occur in other disorders, there are some special features in the way the symptoms are manifest that justify the inclusion of these states as a clinical entity. The third condition in this section - post-traumatic stress disorder - has relatively specific and characteristic clinical features.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">These disorders can thus be regarded as maladaptive responses to severe or continued stress, in that they interfere with successful coping mechanisms and thus lead to problems in social functioning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Acts of self-harm, most commonly self-poisoning by prescribed medication, that are associated closely in time with the onset of either a stress reaction or an adjustment disorder should be recorded by means of an additional X code from ICD-10, Chapter XX. These codes do not allow differentiation between attempted suicide and &quot;parasuicide&quot;, both being included in the general category of self-harm.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F43.0 Acute stress reaction</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">A transient disorder of significant severity which develops in an individual without any other apparent mental disorder in response to exceptional physical and/or mental stress and which usually subsides within hours or days.  The stressor may be an overwhelming traumatic experience involving serious threat to the security or physical integrity of the individual or of a loved person(s) (e.g. natural catastrophe, accident, battle, criminal assault, rape), or an unusually sudden and threatening change in the social position and/or network of the individual, such as multiple bereavement or domestic fire.  The risk of this disorder developing is increased if physical exhaustion or organic factors (e.g. in the elderly) are also present.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Individual vulnerability and coping capacity play a role in the occurrence and severity of acute stress reactions, as evidenced by the fact that not all people exposed to exceptional stress develop the disorder. The symptoms show great variation but typically they include an initial state of &quot;daze&quot;, with some constriction of the field of consciousness and narrowing of attention, inability to comprehend stimuli, and disorientation. This state may be followed either by further withdrawal from the surrounding situation (to the extent of a dissociative stupor - see F44.2), or by agitation and over-activity (flight reaction or fugue). Autonomic signs of panic anxiety (tachycardia, sweating, flushing) are commonly present. The symptoms usually appear within minutes of the impact of the stressful stimulus or event, and disappear within 2-3 days (often within hours). Partial or complete amnesia (see F44.0) for the episode may be present.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">There must be an immediate and clear temporal connection between the impact of an exceptional stressor and the onset of symptoms; onset is usually within a few minutes, if not immediate. In addition, the symptoms:</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: justify;">(a)show a mixed and usually changing picture; in addition to the initial state of &quot;daze&quot;, depression, anxiety, anger, despair, overactivity, and withdrawal may all be seen, but no one type of symptom predominates for long;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: justify;">(b)resolve rapidly (within a few hours at the most) in those cases where removal from the stressful environment is possible; in cases where the stress continues or cannot by its nature be reversed, the symptoms usually begin to diminish after 24-48 hours and are usually minimal after about 3 days.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This diagnosis should not be used to cover sudden exacerbations of symptoms in individuals already showing symptoms that fulfil the criteria of any other psychiatric disorder, except for those in F60.- (personality disorders). However, a history of previous psychiatric disorder does not invalidate the use of this diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -84pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="s12">: acute crisis reaction combat fatigue crisis state psychic shock</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F43.1 Post-traumatic stress disorder</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This arises as a delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which is likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone (e.g. natural or man-made disaster, combat, serious accident, witnessing the violent death of others, or being the victim of torture, terrorism, rape, or other crime). Predisposing factors such as personality traits (e.g. compulsive, asthenic) or previous history of neurotic illness may lower the threshold for the development of the syndrome or aggravate its course, but they are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain its occurrence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Typical symptoms include episodes of repeated reliving of the trauma in intrusive memories (&quot;flashbacks&quot;) or dreams, occurring against the persisting background of a sense of &quot;numbness&quot; and emotional blunting, detachment from other people, unresponsiveness to surroundings, anhedonia, and avoidance of activities and situations reminiscent of the trauma. Commonly there is fear and avoidance of cues that remind the sufferer of the original trauma. Rarely, there may be dramatic, acute bursts of fear, panic or aggression, triggered by stimuli arousing a sudden recollection and/or re-enactment of the trauma or of the original reaction to it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">There is usually a state of autonomic hyperarousal with hypervigilance, an enhanced startle reaction, and insomnia. Anxiety and depression are commonly associated with the above symptoms and signs, and suicidal ideation is not infrequent. Excessive use of alcohol or drugs may be a complicating factor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The onset follows the trauma with a latency period which may range from a few weeks to months (but rarely exceeds 6 months). The course is fluctuating but recovery can be expected in the majority of cases. In a small proportion of patients the condition may show a chronic course over many years and a transition to an enduring personality change (see F62.0).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">This disorder should not generally be diagnosed unless there is evidence that it arose within 6 months of a traumatic event of exceptional severity. A &quot;probable&quot; diagnosis might still be possible if the delay between the event and the onset was longer than 6 months, provided that the clinical manifestations are typical and no alternative identification of the disorder (e.g. as an anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder or depressive episode) is plausible. In addition to evidence of trauma, there must be a repetitive, intrusive recollection or re-enactment of the event in memories, daytime imagery, or dreams. Conspicuous emotional detachment, numbing of feeling, and avoidance of stimuli that might arouse recollection of the trauma are</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">often present but are not essential for the diagnosis. The autonomic disturbances, mood disorder, and behavioural abnormalities all contribute to the diagnosis but are not of prime importance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The late chronic sequelae of devastating stress, i.e. those manifest decades after the stressful experience, should be classified under F62.0.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Includes<span class="s12">: traumatic neurosis</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F43.2 Adjustment disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">States of subjective distress and emotional disturbance, usually interfering with social functioning and performance, and arising in the period of adaptation to a significant life change or to the consequences of a stressful life event (including the presence or possibility of serious physical illness). The stressor may have affected the integrity of an individual&#39;s social network (through bereavement or separation experiences) or the wider system of social supports and values (migration or refugee status). The stressor may involve only the individual or also his or her group or community.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Individual predisposition or vulnerability plays a greater role in the risk of occurrence and the shaping of the manifestations of adjustment disorders than it does in the other conditions in F43.-, but it is nevertheless assumed that the condition would not have arisen without the stressor. The manifestations vary, and include depressed mood, anxiety, worry (or a mixture of these), a feeling of inability to cope, plan ahead, or continue in the present situation, and some degree of disability in the performance of daily routine. The individual may feel liable to dramatic behaviour or outbursts of violence, but these rarely occur. However, conduct disorders (e.g. aggressive or dissocial behaviour) may be an associated feature, particularly in adolescents. None of the symptoms is of sufficient severity or prominence in its own right to justify a more specific diagnosis. In children, regressive phenomena such as return to bed-wetting, babyish speech, or thumb-sucking are frequently part of the symptom pattern. If these features predominate, F43.23 should be used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The onset is usually within 1 month of the occurrence of the stressful event or life change, and the duration of symptoms does not usually exceed 6 months, except in the case of prolonged depressive reaction (F43.21). If the symptoms persist beyond this period, the diagnosis should be changed according to the clinical picture present, and any continuing stress can be coded by means of one of the Z codes in Chapter XXI of ICD-10.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Contacts with medical and psychiatric services because of normal bereavement reactions, appropriate to the culture of the individual concerned and not usually exceeding 6 months in duration, should not be recorded by means of the codes in this book but by a code from Chapter XXI of ICD-10 such as Z63.4 (disappearance or death of family member) plus for example Z71.9 (counselling) or Z73.3 (stress not elsewhere classified). Grief reactions of any duration, considered to be abnormal because of their form or content, should be coded as F43.22, F43.23, F43.24 or F43.25, and those that are still intense and last longer than 6 months as F43.21 (prolonged depressive reaction).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;line-height: 23pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis depends on a careful evaluation of the relationship between: (a)form, content, and severity of symptoms;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b)previous history and personality; and (c)stressful event, situation, or life crisis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The presence of this third factor should be clearly established and there should be strong, though perhaps presumptive, evidence that the disorder would not have arisen without it.

Symptoms of anxiety and depression may fulfil the criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (F41.2) or other mixed anxiety disorder (F41.3), but they are not so predominant that other more specific depressive or anxiety disorders can be diagnosed.

There is normally a considerable degree of conscious control over the memories and sensations that can be selected for immediate attention, and the movements that are to be carried out. In the dissociative disorders it is presumed that this ability to exercise a conscious and selective control is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. It is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of functions might be under voluntary control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">These disorders have previously been classified as various types of &quot;conversion hysteria&quot;, but it now seems best to avoid the term &quot;hysteria&quot; as far as possible, in view of its many and varied</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">meanings. Dissociative disorders as described here are presumed to be &quot;psychogenic&quot; in origin, being associated closely in time with traumatic events, insoluble and intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. It is therefore often possible to make interpretations and presumptions about the individual&#39;s means of dealing within intolerable stress, but concepts derived from any one particular theory, such as &quot;unconscious motivation&quot; and &quot;secondary gain&quot;, are not included among the guidelines or criteria for diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The term &quot;conversion&quot; is widely applied to some of these disorders, and implies that the unpleasant affect, engendered by the problems and conflicts that the individual cannot solve, is somehow transformed into the symptoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">The onset and termination of dissociative states are often reported as being sudden, but they are rarely observed except during contrived interactions or procedures such as hypnosis or abreaction. Change in or disappearance of a dissociative state may be limited to the duration of such procedures. All types of dissociative state tend to remit after a few weeks or months, particularly if their onset was associated with a</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">traumatic life event. More chronic states, particularly paralyses and anaesthesias, may develop (sometimes more slowly) if they are associated with insoluble problems or interpersonal difficulties. Dissociative states that have endured for more than 1-2 years before coming to psychiatric attention are often resistant to therapy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">Individuals with dissociative disorders often show a striking denial of problems or difficulties that may be obvious to others.

The amnesia is usually centred on traumatic events, such as accidents or unexpected bereavements, and is usually partial and selective. The extent and completeness of the</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">amnesia often vary from day to day and between investigators, but there is a persistent common core that cannot be recalled in the waking state.

Perplexity, distress, and varying degrees of attention-seeking behaviour may be evident, but calm acceptance is also sometimes striking. Young adults are most commonly affected, the most extreme instances usually occurring in men subject to battle stress. Nonorganic dissociative states are rare in the elderly. Purposeless local wandering may occur; it is usually accompanied by self-neglect and rarely lasts more than a day or two.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A definite diagnosis requires:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)amnesia, either partial or complete, for recent events that are of a traumatic or stressful nature (these aspects may emerge only when other informants are available);</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(b)absence of organic brain disorders, intoxication, or excessive fatigue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">In organic mental disorders, there are usually other signs of disturbance in the nervous system, plus obvious and consistent signs of clouding of consciousness, disorientation, and fluctuating awareness. Loss of very recent memory is more typical of organic states, irrespective of any possibly traumatic events or problems. &quot;Blackouts&quot; due to abuse of alcohol or drugs are closely associated with the time of abuse, and the lost memories can never be regained. The short-term memory loss of the amnesic state (Korsakov&#39;s syndrome), in which immediate recall is normal but recall after only 2-3 minutes is lost, is not found in dissociative amnesia.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Amnesia following concussion or serious head injury is usually retrograde, although in severe cases it may be anterograde also; dissociative amnesia is usually predominantly retrograde. Only dissociative amnesia can be modified by hypnosis or abreaction. Postictal amnesia in epileptics, and other states of stupor or mutism occasionally found in schizophrenic or depressive illnesses can usually be differentiated by other characteristics of the underlying illness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The most difficult differentiation is from conscious simulation of amnesia (malingering), and repeated and detailed assessment of premorbid personality and motivation may be required. Conscious simulation of amnesia is usually associated with obvious problems concerning money, danger of death in wartime, or possible prison or death sentences.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Excludes<span class="s12">: alcohol- or other psychoactive substance-induced amnesic disorder</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 57pt;text-align: left;">(F10-F19 with common fourth character . 6) amnesia NOS (R41.3)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">anterograde amnesia (R41.1)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nonalcoholic organic amnesic syndrome (F04) postictal amnesia in epilepsy (G40.-) retrograde amnesia (R41.2)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.1 Dissociative fugue</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dissociative fugue has all the features of dissociative amnesia, plus an apparently purposeful journey away from home or place of work during which self-care is maintained. In some cases, a new identity may be assumed, usually only for a few days but occasionally for long periods of time and to a surprising degree of completeness. Organized travel may be to places previously known and of emotional significance. Although there is amnesia for the period of the fugue, the individual&#39;s behaviour during this time may appear completely normal to independent observers.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 23pt;text-align: left;">For a definite diagnosis there should be: (a)the features of dissociative amnesia (F44.0);</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">(b)purposeful travel beyond the usual everyday range (the differentiation between travel and</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">wandering must be made by those with local knowledge); and</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)maintenance of basic self-care (eating, washing, etc.) and simple social interaction with strangers (such as buying tickets or petrol, asking directions, ordering meals).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">Differentiation from postictal fugue, seen particularly after temporal lobe epilepsy, is usually clear because of the history of epilepsy, the lack of stressful events or problems, and the less purposeful and more fragmented activities and travel of the epileptic.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As with dissociative amnesia, differentiation from conscious simulation of a fugue may be very difficult.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.2 Dissociative stupor</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The individual&#39;s behaviour fulfils the criteria for stupor, but examination and investigation reveal no evidence of a physical cause. In addition, as in other dissociative disorders, there is positive evidence of psychogenic causation in the form of either recent stressful events or prominent interpersonal or social problems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Stupor is diagnosed on the basis of a profound diminution or absence of voluntary movement and normal responsiveness to external stimuli such as light, noise, and touch. The individual lies or sits largely motionless for long periods of time. Speech and spontaneous and purposeful movement are completely or almost completely absent. Although some degree of disturbance of consciousness may be present, muscle tone, posture, breathing, and sometimes eye-opening and coordinated eye movements are such that it is clear that the individual is neither asleep nor unconscious.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 23pt;text-align: left;">For a definite diagnosis there should be: (a)stupor, as described above;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">(b)absence of a physical or other psychiatric disorder that might explain the stupor; and</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(c)evidence of recent stressful events or current problems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">Dissociative stupor must be differentiated from catatonic stupor and depressive or manic stupor. The stupor of catatonic schizophrenia is often preceded by symptoms or behaviour suggestive of schizophrenia. Depressive and manic stupor usually develop comparatively slowly, so a history from another informant should be decisive. Both depressive and manic stupor are increasingly rare in many countries as early treatment of affective illness becomes more widespread.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.3 Trance and possession disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disorders in which there is a temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surroundings; in some instances the individual acts as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or &quot;force&quot;. Attention and awareness may be limited to or concentrated upon only one or two aspects of the immediate environment, and there is often a limited but repeated set of movements, postures, and utterances. Only trance disorders that are involuntary or unwanted, and that intrude into ordinary activities by occurring outside (or being a prolongation of) religious or other culturally accepted situations should be included here.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Trance disorders occurring during the course of schizophrenic or acute psychoses with hallucinations or delusions, or multiple personality should not be included here, nor should this category be used if the trance disorder is judged to be closely associated with any physical disorder (such as temporal lobe epilepsy or head injury) or with psychoactive substance intoxication.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F44.4-F44.7   Dissociative disorders of movement and sensation</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In these disorders there is a loss of or interference with movements or loss of sensations (usually cutaneous). The patient therefore presents as having a physical disorder, although none can be found that would explain the symptoms. The symptoms can often be seen to represent the patient&#39;s concept of physical disorder, which may be at variance with physiological or anatomical principles. In addition, assessment of the patient&#39;s mental state and social situation usually suggests that the disability resulting from the loss of functions is helping the patient to escape from an unpleasant conflict, or to express dependency or resentment indirectly. Although problems or conflicts may be evident to others, the patient often denies their presence and attributes any distress to the symptoms or the resulting disability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The degree of disability resulting from all these types of symptom may vary from occasion to occasion, depending upon the number and type of other people present, and upon the emotional state of the patient. In other words, a variable amount of attention-seeking behaviour may be present in addition to a central and unvarying core of loss of movement or sensation which is not under voluntary control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In some patients, the symptoms usually develop in close relationship to psychological stress, but in others this link does not emerge. Calm acceptance (&quot;belle indifférence&quot;) of serious disability may be striking, but is not universal; it is also found in well-adjusted individuals facing obvious and serious physical illness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Premorbid abnormalities of personal relationships and personality are usually found, and close relatives and friends may have suffered from physical illness with symptoms resembling those of the patient. Mild and transient varieties of these disorders are often seen in adolescence, particularly in girls, but the chronic varieties are usually found in young adults. A few individuals establish a repetitive pattern of reaction to stress by the production of these disorders, and may still manifest this in middle and old age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disorders involving only <span class="s15">loss </span>of sensations are included here; disorders involving additional sensations such as pain, and other complex sensations mediated by the autonomic nervous system are included in somatoform disorders (F45.-).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The diagnosis should be made with great caution in the presence of physical disorders of the nervous system, or in a previously well-adjusted individual with normal family and social relationships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(a)there should be no evidence of physical disorder; and</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">(b)sufficient must be known about the psychological and social setting and personal relationships of the patient to allow a convincing formulation to be made of the reasons for the appearance of the disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The diagnosis should remain probable or provisional if there is any doubt about the contribution of actual or possible physical disorders, or if it is impossible to achieve an understanding of why the disorder has developed. In cases that are puzzling or not clear-cut,</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the possibility of the later appearance of serious physical or psychiatric disorders should always be kept in mind.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">The early stages of progressive neurological disorders, particularly multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, may be confused with dissociative disorders of movement and sensation. Patients reacting to early multiple sclerosis with distress and attention-seeking behaviour pose especially difficult problems; comparatively long periods of assessment and observation may be needed before the diagnostic probabilities become clear.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Multiple and ill-defined somatic complaints should be classified elsewhere, under somatoform disorders (F45.-) or neurasthenia (F48.0).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Isolated dissociative symptoms may occur during major mental disorders such as schizophrenia or severe depression, but these disorders are usually obvious and should take precedence over the dissociative symptoms for diagnostic and coding purposes.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Conscious simulation of loss of movement and sensation is often very difficult to distinguish from dissociation; the decision will rest upon detailed observation, and upon obtaining an understanding of the personality of the patient, the circumstances surrounding the onset of the disorder, and the consequences of recovery versus continued disability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.4 Dissociative motor disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The commonest varieties of dissociative motor disorder are loss of ability to move the whole or a part of a limb or limbs. Paralysis may be partial, with movements being weak or slow, or complete. Various forms and variable degrees of incoordination (ataxia) may be evident, particularly in the legs, resulting in bizarre gait or inability to stand unaided (astasia-abasia). There may also be exaggerated trembling or shaking of one or more extremities or the whole body. There may be close resemblance to almost any variety of ataxia, apraxia, akinesia, aphonia, dysarthria, dyskinesia, or paralysis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Includes<span class="s12">: psychogenic aphonia</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">psychogenic dysphonia</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.5 Dissociative convulsions</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dissociative convulsions (pseudoseizures) may mimic epileptic seizures very closely in terms of movements, but tongue-biting, serious bruising due to falling, and incontinence of urine are rare in dissociative convulsion, and loss of consciousness is absent or replaced by a state of stupor or trance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.6 Dissociative anaesthesia and sensory loss</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anaesthetic areas of skin often have boundaries which make it clear that they are associated more with the patient&#39;s ideas about bodily functions than with medical knowledge. There may also be differential loss between the sensory modalities which cannot be due to a neurological lesion. Sensory loss may be accompanied by complaints of paraesthesia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Loss of vision is rarely total in dissociative disorders, and visual disturbances are more often a loss of acuity, general blurring of vision, or &quot;tunnel vision&quot;. In spite of complaints of visual loss, the patient&#39;s general mobility and motor performance are often surprisingly well preserved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dissociative deafness and anosmia are far less common than loss of sensation or vision.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Includes<span class="s12">: psychogenic deafness</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.7 Mixed dissociative [conversion] disorders</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mixtures of the disorders specified above (F44.0-F44.6) should be coded here.</p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F44.8 Other dissociative [conversion] disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">F44.80 Ganser&#39;s syndrome</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The complex disorder described by Ganser, which is characterized by &quot;approximate answers&quot;, usually accompanied by several other dissociative symptoms, often in circumstances that suggest a psychogenic etiology, should be coded here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">F44.81 Multiple personality disorder</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This disorder is rare, and controversy exists about the extent to which it is iatrogenic or culture-specific. The essential feature is the apparent existence of two or more distinct personalities within an individual, with only one of them being evident at a time. Each personality is complete, with its own memories, behaviour, and preferences; these may be in marked contrast to the single premorbid personality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the common form with two personalities, one personality is usually dominant but neither has access to the memories of the other and the two are almost always unaware of each other&#39;s existence. Change from one personality to another in the first instance is usually sudden and closely associated with traumatic events.

If any physical disorders are present, they do not explain the nature and extent of the symptoms or the distress and preoccupation of the patient. Even when the onset and continuation of the symptoms bear a close relationship with unpleasant life events or with difficulties or conflicts, the patient usually resists attempts to discuss the possibility of psychological causation; this may even be the case in the presence of obvious depressive and anxiety symptoms. The degree of understanding, either physical or psychological, that can be achieved about the cause of the symptoms is often disappointing and frustrating for both patient and doctor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In these disorders there is often a degree of attention-seeking (histrionic) behaviour, particularly in patients who are resentful of their failure to persuade doctors of the essentially physical nature of their illness and of the need for further investigations or examinations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">Differentiation from hypochondriacal delusions usually depends upon close acquaintance with the patient. Although the beliefs are long-standing and appear to be held against reason, the degree of conviction is usually susceptible, to some degree and in the short term, to argument, reassurance, and the performance of yet another examination or investigation. In addition, the presence of unpleasant and frightening physical sensations can be regarded as a culturally acceptable explanation for the development and persistence of a conviction of physical illness.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Excludes: <span class="s12">dissociative disorders (F44.-)</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hair-plucking (F98.4) lalling (F80.0)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lisping (F80.8) nail-biting (F98.8)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: -50pt;text-align: left;">psychological or behavioural factors associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere (F54)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sexual dysfunction, not caused by organic disorder or disease (F52.-) thumb-sucking (F98.8)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tic disorders (in childhood and adolescence) (F95.-) Tourette&#39;s syndrome (F95.2)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">trichotillomania (F63.3)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F45.0 Somatization disorder</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main features are multiple, recurrent, and frequently changing physical symptoms, which have usually been present for several years before the patient is referred to a psychiatrist. Most patients have a long and complicated history of contact with both primary and specialist medical services, during which many negative investigations or fruitless operations may have been carried out. Symptoms may be referred to any part or system of the body, but gastrointestinal sensations (pain, belching, regurgitation, vomiting, nausea, etc.), and abnormal skin sensations (itching, burning, tingling, numbness, soreness, etc.) and blotchiness are among the commonest.

In hypochondriacal disorder, the patient tends to ask for investigations to determine or confirm the nature of the underlying disease, whereas the patient with somatization disorder asks for treatment to remove the symptoms. In somatization disorder there is usually excessive drug use, together with noncompliance over long periods, whereas patients with hypochondriacal disorder fear drugs and their side-effects, and seek for reassurance by frequent visits to different physicians.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delusional disorders <span class="s12">(such as schizophrenia with somatic delusions, and depressive disorders with hypochondriacal delusions).

For instance, the forceful and dramatic manner of complaint may be lacking, the complaints may be comparatively few in number, or the associated impairment of social and family functioning may be totally absent.

Patients manifest persistent somatic complaints or persistent preoccupation with their physical appearance. Normal or commonplace sensations and appearances are often interpreted by a patient as abnormal and distressing, and attention is usually focused on only one or two organs or systems of the body. The feared physical disorder or disfigurement may be named by the patient, but even so the degree of conviction about its presence and the emphasis upon one disorder rather than another usually varies between consultations; the patient will usually entertain the possibility that other or additional physical disorders may exist in addition to the one given pre-eminence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Marked depression and anxiety are often present, and may justify additional diagnosis. The disorders rarely present for the first time after the age of 50 years, and the course of both symptoms and disability is usually chronic and fluctuating. There must be no fixed delusions about bodily functions or shape. Fears of the presence of one or more diseases (nosophobia) should be classified here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This syndrome occurs in both men and women, and there are no special familial characteristics (in contrast to somatization disorder).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many individuals, especially those with milder forms of the disorder, remain within primary care or nonpsychiatric medical specialties. Psychiatric referral is often resented, unless accomplished early in the development of the disorder and with tactful collaboration between physician and psychiatrist. The degree of associated disability is very variable; some individuals dominate or manipulate family and social networks as a result of their symptoms, in contrast to a minority who function almost normally.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For a definite diagnosis, both of the following should be present:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)persistent belief in the presence of at least one serious physical illness underlying the presenting symptom or symptoms, even though repeated investigations and examinations have identified no adequate physical explanation, or a persistent preoccupation with a presumed deformity or disfigurement;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)persistent refusal to accept the advice and reassurance of several different doctors that there is no physical illness or abnormality underlying the symptoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="s12">:body dysmorphic disorder</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dysmorphophobia (nondelusional) hypochondriacal neurosis hypochondriasis</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nosophobia</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">Differentiation from the following disorders is essential:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Somatization disorder. <span class="s12">Emphasis is on the presence of the disorder itself and its future consequences, rather than on the individual symptoms as in somatization disorder.

(Some aspects of the genitourinary system are also included here.) The most common and striking examples affect the cardiovascular system (&quot;cardiac neurosis&quot;), the respiratory system (psychogenic hyperventilation and hiccough) and the gastrointestinal system (&quot;gastric neurosis&quot; and &quot;nervous diarrhoea&quot;). The symptoms are usually of two types, neither of which indicates a physical disorder of the organ or system concerned. The first type, upon which this diagnosis largely depends, is characterized by complaints based upon objective signs of autonomic arousal, such as palpitations, sweating, flushing, and tremor. The second type is characterized by more idiosyncratic, subjective, and nonspecific symptoms, such as sensations of fleeting aches and pains, burning, heaviness, tightness, and sensations of being bloated or distended; these are referred by the patient to a specific organ or system (as the autonomic symptoms may also be). It is the combination of clear autonomic involvement, additional nonspecific subjective complaints, and persistent referral to a particular organ or system as the cause of the disorder that gives the characteristic clinical picture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In many patients with this disorder there will also be evidence of psychological stress, or current difficulties and problems that appear to be related to the disorder; however, this is not the case in a substantial proportion of patients who nevertheless clearly fulfil the criteria for this condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some of these disorders, some minor disturbance of physiological function may also be present, such as hiccough, flatulence, and hyperventilation, but these do not of themselves disturb the essential physiological function of the relevant organ or system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definite diagnosis requires all of the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)symptoms of autonomic arousal, such as palpitations, sweating, tremor, flushing, which are persistent and troublesome;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b)additional subjective symptoms referred to a specific organ or system;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)preoccupation with and distress about the possibility of a serious (but often unspecified) disorder of the stated organ or system, which does not respond to repeated explanation and reassurance by doctors;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(d)no evidence of a significant disturbance of structure or function of the stated system or organ.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">Differentiation from generalized anxiety disorder is based on the predominance of the psychological, components of autonomic arousal, such as fear and anxious foreboding in generalized anxiety disorder, and the lack of a</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">consistent physical focus for the other symptoms.

In one type, the main feature is a complaint of increased fatigue after mental effort, often associated with some decrease in occupational performance or coping efficiency in daily tasks. The mental fatiguability is typically described as an unpleasant intrusion of distracting associations or recollections, difficulty in concentrating, and generally inefficient thinking. In the other type, the emphasis is on feelings of bodily or physical weakness and exhaustion after only minimal effort, accompanied by a feeling of muscular aches and pains and inability to relax. In both types, a variety of other unpleasant physical feelings, such as dizziness, tension headaches, and a sense of general instability, is common. Worry about decreasing mental and bodily well-being, irritability, anhedonia, and varying minor degrees of both depression and anxiety are all common. Sleep is often disturbed in its initial and middle phases but hypersomnia may also be prominent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Definite diagnosis requires the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)either persistent and distressing complaints of increased fatigue after mental effort, or persistent and distressing complaints of bodily weakness and exhaustion after minimal effort;</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b)at least two of the following:</p><ul id="l40"><li style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">feelings of muscular aches and pains</p></li><li style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">dizziness</p></li><li style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">tension headaches</p></li><li style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">sleep disturbance</p></li><li style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">inability to relax</p></li><li style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">irritability</p></li><li style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s12" style="display: inline;">dyspepsia;</p></li></ul><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)any autonomic or depressive symptoms present are not sufficiently persistent and severe to fulfil the criteria for any of the more specific disorders in this classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="s12">: fatigue syndrome</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="s12">In many countries neurasthenia is not generally used as a diagnostic category. Many of the cases so diagnosed in the past would meet the current criteria for depressive disorder or anxiety disorder. There are, however, cases that fit the description of neurasthenia better than that of any other neurotic syndrome, and such cases seem to be more frequent in some cultures than in others. If the diagnostic category of neurasthenia is used, an attempt should be made first to rule out a depressive illness or an anxiety disorder. Hallmarks of the syndrome are the patient&#39;s emphasis on fatiguability and weakness and concern about lowered mental and physical efficiency (in contrast to the somatoform disorders, where bodily complaints and preoccupation with physical disease dominate the picture). If the neurasthenic syndrome develops in the aftermath of a physical illness (particularly influenza, viral hepatitis, or infectious mononucleosis), the diagnosis of the latter should also be recorded.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="s12">: asthenia NOS (R53)</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">burn-out (Z73.0)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">malaise and fatigue (R53)</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">postviral fatigue syndrome (G93.3) psychasthenia (F48.8)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F48.1    Depersonalization-derealization syndrome</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A disorder in which the sufferer complains that his or her mental activity, body, and/or surroundings are changed in their quality, so as to be unreal, remote, or automatized. Individuals may feel that they are no longer doing their own thinking, imaging, or remembering; that their movements and behaviour are somehow not their own; that their body seems lifeless, detached, or otherwise anomalous; and that their surroundings seem to lack colour and life and appear as artificial, or as a stage on which people are acting contrived roles.

The disorder occurs most commonly in adolescent girls and young women, but adolescent boys and young men may be affected more rarely, as may children approaching puberty and older women up to the menopause. Anorexia nervosa constitutes an independent syndrome in the following sense:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)the clinical features of the syndrome are easily recognized, so that diagnosis is reliable with a high level of agreement between clinicians;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">(b)follow-up studies have shown that, among patients who do not recover, a considerable number continue to show the same main features of anorexia nervosa, in a chronic form.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although the fundamental causes of anorexia nervosa remain elusive, there is growing evidence that interacting sociocultural and biological factors contribute to its causation, as do less specific psychological mechanisms and a vulnerability of personality. The disorder is associated with undernutrition of varying severity, with resulting secondary endocrine and metabolic changes and disturbances of bodily function. There remains some doubt as to whether the characteristic endocrine disorder is entirely due to the undernutrition and the direct effect of various behaviours that have brought it about (e.g. restricted dietary choice, excessive exercise and alterations in body composition, induced vomiting and purgation and the consequent electrolyte disturbances), or whether uncertain factors are also involved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For a definite diagnosis, all the following are required:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l42"><li style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Body weight is maintained at least 15% below that expected (either lost or never achieved), or Quetelet&#39;s body-mass index<span class="s20">4</span><span class="s21"> </span>is 17.5 or less.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="182" height="1" alt="image" src="icd_bluebook/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span class="s22">4 </span>Quetelet&#39;s body-mass index = <u>weight (kg)</u> to be used for age 16 or more</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prepubertal patients may show failure to make the expected weight gain during the period of growth.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">The weight loss is self-induced by avoidance of &quot;fattening foods&quot;.

Patients who have all the key symptoms but to only a mild degree may also be best described by this term. This term should not be used for eating disorders that resemble anorexia nervosa but that are due to known physical illness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F50.2 Bulimia nervosa</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bulimia nervosa is a syndrome characterized by repeated bouts of overeating and an excessive preoccupation with the control of body weight, leading the patient to adopt extreme measures so as to mitigate the &quot;fattening&quot; effects of ingested food.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The term should be restricted to the form of the disorder that is related to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="522" height="1" alt="image" src="icd_bluebook/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 208pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">[height (m)]<span class="s22">2</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">anorexia nervosa by virtue of sharing the same psychopathology. The age and sex distribution is similar to that of anorexia nervosa, but the age of presentation tends to be slightly later. The disorder may be viewed as a sequel to persistent anorexia nervosa (although the reverse sequence may also occur). A previously anorexic patient may first appear to improve as a result of weight gain and possibly a return of menstruation, but a pernicious pattern of overeating and vomiting then becomes established. Repeated vomiting is likely to give rise to disturbances of body electrolytes, physical complications (tetany, epileptic seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, muscular weakness), and further severe loss of weight.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For a definite diagnosis, all the following are required:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l43"><li style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">There is a persistent preoccupation with eating, and an irresistible craving for food; the patient succumbs to episodes of overeating in which large amounts of food are consumed in short periods of time.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">The patient attempts to counteract the &quot;fattening&quot; effects of food by one or more of the following: self-induced vomiting; purgative abuse, alternating periods of starvation; use of drugs such as appetite suppressants, thyroid preparations or diuretics.

There is often, but not always, a history of an earlier episode of anorexia nervosa, the interval between the two disorders ranging from a few months to several years. This earlier episode may have been fully expressed, or may have assumed a minor cryptic form with a moderate loss of weight and/or a transient phase of amenorrhoea.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="p">: bulimia NOS</span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hyperorexia nervosa</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Bulimia nervosa must be differentiated from:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)upper gastrointestinal disorders leading to repeated vomiting (the characteristic psychopathology is absent);</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)a more general abnormality of personality (the eating disorder may coexist with alcohol dependence and petty offenses such as shoplifting);</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c)depressive disorder (bulimic patients often experience depressive symptoms).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F50.3 Atypical bulimia nervosa</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This term should be used for those individuals in whom one or more of the key features listed for bulimia nervosa (F50.2) is absent, but who otherwise present a fairly typical clinical picture.

Sleep disorders of organic origin such as Kleine-Levin syndrome (G47.8) are coded in Chapter VI (G47.-) of ICD-10. Nonpsychogenic disorders including narcolepsy and cataplexy (G47.4) and disorders of the sleep - wake schedule (G47.2) are also listed in Chapter VI, as are sleep apnoea (G47.3) and episodic movement disorders which include nocturnal myoclonus (G25.3). Finally, enuresis (F98.0) is listed with other emotional and behavioural disorders with onset specific to childhood and adolescence, while primary nocturnal enuresis (R33.8), which is considered to be due to a maturational delay of bladder control during sleep, is listed in Chapter XVIII of ICD-10 among the symptoms involving the urinary system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In many cases, a disturbance of sleep is one of the symptoms of another disorder, either mental or physical. Even when a specific sleep disorder appears to be clinically independent, a number of associated psychiatric and/or physical factors may contribute to its occurrence. Whether a sleep disorder in a given individual is an independent condition or simply one of the features of another disorder (classified elsewhere in Chapter V or in other chapters of ICD-10) should be determined on the basis of its clinical presentation and course, as well as of therapeutic considerations and priorities at the time of the consultation. In any event, whenever the disturbance of sleep is among the predominant complaints, a sleep disorder should be diagnosed. Generally, however, it is preferable to list the diagnosis of the specific sleep disorder along with as many other pertinent diagnoses as are necessary to describe adequately the psychopathology and/or pathophysiology involved in a given case.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">sleep disorders (organic) (G47.-)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F51.0 Nonorganic insomnia</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insomnia is a condition of unsatisfactory quantity and/or quality of sleep, which persists for a considerable period of time.  The actual degree of deviation from what is generally considered as a normal amount of sleep should not be the primary consideration in the diagnosis of insomnia, because some individuals (the so-called short sleepers) obtain a minimal amount of sleep and yet do not consider themselves as insomniacs.  Conversely, there are people who suffer immensely from the poor quality of their sleep, while sleep quantity is judged subjectively and/or objectively as within normal limits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Among insomniacs, difficulty falling asleep is the most prevalent complaint, followed by difficulty staying asleep and early final wakening. Usually, however, patients report a combination of these complaints. Typically, insomnia develops at a time of increased life-stress and tends to be more prevalent among women, older individuals and psychologically disturbed and socioeconomically disadvantaged people. When insomnia is repeatedly experienced, it can lead to an increased fear of sleeplessness and a preoccupation with its consequences. This creates a vicious circle which tends to perpetuate the individual&#39;s problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Individuals with insomnia describe themselves as feeling tense, anxious, worried, or depressed at bedtime, and as though their thoughts are racing. They frequently ruminate over getting enough sleep, personal problems, health status, and even death. Often they attempt to cope with their tension by taking medication or alcohol. In the morning, they frequently report feeling physically and mentally tired; during the day, they characteristically feel depressed, worried, tense, irritable, and preoccupied with themselves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Children are often said to have difficulty sleeping when in reality the problem is a difficulty in the management of bedtime routines (rather than of sleep <span class="s18">per se</span>); bedtime difficulties should not be coded here, but in Chapter XXI of ICD-10 (Z62.0, inadequate parental supervision and control).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following are essential clinical features for a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)the complaint is either of difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep, or of poor quality of sleep;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)the sleep disturbance has occurred at least three times per week for at least 1 month;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)there is preoccupation with the sleeplessness and excessive concern over its consequences at night and during the day;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(d)the unsatisfactory quantity and/or quality of sleep either causes marked distress or interferes with ordinary activities in daily living.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whenever unsatisfactory quantity and/or quality of sleep is the patient&#39;s only complaint, the disorder should be coded here.  The presence of other psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety or obsessions does not invalidate the diagnosis of insomnia, provided that insomnia is the primary complaint or the chronicity and severity of insomnia cause the patient to perceive it as the primary</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">disorder. Other coexisting disorders should be coded if they are sufficiently marked and persistent to justify treatment in their own right. It should be noted that most chronic insomniacs are usually preoccupied with their sleep disturbance and deny the existence of any emotional problems. Thus, careful clinical assessment is necessary before ruling out a psychological basis for the complaint.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insomnia is a common symptom of other mental disorders, such as affective, neurotic, organic, and eating disorders, substance use, and schizophrenia, and of other sleep disorders such as nightmares. Insomnia may also be associated with physical disorders in which there is pain and discomfort or with taking certain medications. If insomnia occurs only as one of the multiple symptoms of a mental disorder or a physical condition, i.e. does not dominate the clinical picture, the diagnosis should be limited to that of the underlying mental or physical disorder. Moreover, the diagnosis of another sleep disorder, such as nightmare, disorder of the sleep-wake schedule, sleep apnoea and nocturnal myoclonus, should be made only when these disorders lead to a reduction in the quantity or quality of sleep.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, in all of the above instances, if insomnia is one of the major complaints and is perceived as a condition in itself, the present code should be added after that of the principal diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The present code does not apply to so-called &quot;transient insomnia&quot;. Transient disturbances of sleep are a normal part of everyday life. Thus, a few nights of sleeplessness related to a psychosocial stressor would not be coded here, but could be considered as part of an acute stress reaction (F43.0) or adjustment disorder (F43.2) if accompanied by other clinically significant features.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F51.1 Nonorganic hypersomnia</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypersomnia is defined as a condition of either excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks (not accounted for by an inadequate amount of sleep) or prolonged transition to the fully aroused state upon awakening. When no definite evidence of organic etiology can be found, this condition is usually associated with mental disorders. It is often found to be a symptom of a bipolar affective disorder currently depressed (F31.3, F31.4 or F31.5), a recurrent depressive disorder (F33.-) or a depressive episode (F32.-). At times, however, the criteria for the diagnosis of another mental disorder cannot be met, although there is often some evidence of a psychopathological basis for the complaint.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some patients will themselves make the connection between their tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times and certain unpleasant daytime experiences. Others will deny such a connection even when a skilled clinician identifies the presence of these experiences. In other cases, no emotional or other psychological factors can be readily identified, but the presumed absence of organic factors suggests that the hypersomnia is most likely of psychogenic origin.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following clinical features are essential for a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)excessive daytime sleepiness or sleep attacks, not accounted for by an inadequate amount of sleep, and/or prolonged transition to the fully aroused state upon awakening (sleep drunkenness);</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)sleep disturbance occurring daily for more than 1 month or for recurrent periods of shorter duration, causing either marked distress or interference with ordinary activities in daily living;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)absence of auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy (cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations) or of clinical evidence for sleep apnoea (nocturnal breath cessation, typical intermittent snorting sounds, etc.);</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(d)absence of any neurological or medical condition of which daytime somnolence may be symptomatic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If hypersomnia occurs only as one of the symptoms of a mental disorder, such as an affective disorder, the diagnosis should be that of the underlying disorder. The diagnosis of psychogenic hypersomnia should be added, however, if hypersomnia is the predominant complaint in patients with other mental disorders. When another diagnosis cannot be made, the present code should be used alone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Differentiating hypersomnia from narcolepsy is essential. In narcolepsy (G47.4), one or more auxiliary symptoms such as cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations are usually present; the sleep attacks are irresistible and more refreshing; and nocturnal sleep is fragmented and curtailed. By contrast, daytime sleep attacks in hypersomnia are usually fewer per day, although each of longer duration; the patient is often able to prevent their occurrence; nocturnal sleep is usually prolonged, and there is a marked difficulty in achieving the fully aroused state upon awakening (sleep drunkenness).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is important to differentiate nonorganic hypersomnia from hypersomnia related to sleep apnoea and other organic hypersomnias. In addition to the symptom of excessive daytime sleepiness, most patients with sleep apnoea have a history of nocturnal cessation of breathing, typical intermittent snorting sounds, obesity, hypertension, impotence, cognitive impairment, nocturnal hypermotility and profuse sweating, morning headaches and incoordination. When there is a strong suspicion of sleep apnoea, confirmation of the diagnosis and quantification of the apnoeic events by means of sleep laboratory recordings should be considered.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hypersomnia due to a definable organic cause (encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and other brain damage, brain tumours, cerebrovascular lesions, degenerative and other neurologic diseases, metabolic disorders, toxic conditions, endocrine abnormalities, post-radiation syndrome) can be differentiated from nonorganic hypersomnia by the presence of the insulting organic factor, as evidenced by the patient&#39;s clinical presentation and the results of appropriate laboratory tests.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F51.2 Nonorganic disorder of the sleep-wake schedule</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A disorder of the sleep-wake schedule is defined as a lack of synchrony between the individual&#39;s sleep-wake schedule and the desired sleep-wake schedule for the environment, resulting in a complaint of either insomnia or hypersomnia. This disorder may be either psychogenic or of presumed organic origin, depending on</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the relative contribution of psychological or organic factors. Individuals with disorganized and variable sleeping and waking times most often present with significant psychological disturbance, usually in association with various psychiatric conditions such as personality disorders and affective disorders. In individuals who frequently change work shifts or travel across time zones, the circadian dysregulation is basically biological, although a strong emotional component may also be operating since many such individuals are distressed. Finally, in some individuals there is a phase advance to the desired sleep-wake schedule, which may be due to either an intrinsic malfunction of the circadian oscillator (biological clock) or an abnormal processing of the time-cues that drive the biological clock (the latter may in fact be related to an emotional and/or cognitive disturbance).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The present code is reserved for those disorders of the sleep-wake schedule in which psychological factors play the most important role, whereas cases of presumed organic origin should be classified under G47.2, i.e. as non-psychogenic disorders of the sleep-wake schedule. Whether or not psychological factors are of primary importance and, therefore, whether the present code or G47.2 should be used is a matter for clinical judgement in each case.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following clinical features are essential for a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)the individual&#39;s sleep-wake pattern is out of synchrony with the sleep-wake schedule that is normal for a particular society and shared by most people in the same cultural environment;</p><ol id="l44"><li style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">insomnia during the major sleep period and hypersomnia during the waking period are experienced nearly every day for at least 1 month or recurrently for shorter periods of time;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)the unsatisfactory quantity, quality, and timing of sleep cause marked distress or interfere with ordinary activities in daily living.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Whenever there is no identifiable psychiatric or physical cause of the disorder, the present code should be used alone.

During a sleepwalking episode the individual arises from bed, usually during the first third of nocturnal sleep, and walks about, exhibiting low levels of awareness, reactivity, and motor skill. A sleepwalker will sometimes leave the bedroom and at times may actually</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">walk out of the house, and is thus exposed to considerable risks of injury during the episode. Most often, however, he or she will return quietly to bed, either unaided or when gently led by another person. Upon awakening either from the sleepwalking episode or the next morning, there is usually no recall of the event.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sleepwalking and sleep terrors (F51.4) are very closely related. Both are considered as disorders of arousal, particularly arousal from the deepest stages of sleep (stages 3 and 4). Many individuals have a positive family history for either condition as well as a personal history of having experienced both. Moreover, both conditions are much more common in childhood, which indicates the role of developmental factors in their etiology. In addition, in some cases, the onset of these conditions coincides with a febrile illness. When they continue beyond childhood or are first observed in adulthood, both conditions tend to be associated with significant psychological disturbance; the conditions may also occur for the first time in old age or in the early stages of dementia. Based upon the clinical and pathogenetic similarities between sleepwalking and sleep terrors, and the fact that the differential diagnosis of these disorders is usually a matter of which of the two is predominant, they have both been considered recently to be part of the same nosologic continuum. For consistency with tradition, however, as well as to emphasize the differences in the intensity of clinical manifestations, separate codes are provided in this classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following clinical features are essential for a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)the predominant symptom is one or more episodes of rising from bed, usually during the first third of nocturnal sleep, and walking about;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)during an episode, the individual has a blank, staring face, is relatively unresponsive to the efforts of others to influence the event or to communicate with him or her, and can be awakened only with considerable difficulty;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)upon awakening (either from an episode or the next morning), the individual has no recollection of the episode;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(d)within several minutes of awakening from the episode, there is no impairment of mental activity or behaviour, although there may initially be a short period of some confusion and disorientation;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(e)there is no evidence of an organic mental disorder such as dementia, or a physical disorder such as epilepsy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Sleepwalking should be differentiated from psychomotor epileptic seizures. Psychomotor epilepsy very seldom occurs only at night.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the epileptic attack the individual is completely unresponsive to environmental stimuli, and perseverative movements such as swallowing and rubbing the hands are common. The presence of epileptic discharges in the EEG confirms the diagnosis, although a seizure disorder does not preclude coexisting sleepwalking.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dissociative fugue (see F44.1) must also be differentiated from sleepwalking. In dissociative disorders the episodes are much longer in duration and patients are more alert and capable of complex and purposeful behaviours. Further, these disorders are rare in children and typically begin during the hours of wakefulness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F51.4 Sleep terrors [night terrors]</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sleep terrors or night terrors are nocturnal episodes of extreme terror and panic associated with intense vocalization, motility, and high levels of autonomic discharge. The individual sits up or gets up with a panicky scream, usually during the first third of nocturnal sleep, often rushing to the door as if trying to escape, although he or she very seldom leaves the room. Efforts of others to influence the sleep terror event may actually lead to more intense fear, since the individual not only is relatively unresponsive to such efforts but may become disoriented for a few minutes. Upon awaking there is usually no recollection of the episode. Because of these clinical characteristics, individuals are at great risk of injury during the episodes of sleep terrors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sleep terrors and sleepwalking (F51.3) are closely related: genetic, developmental, organic, and psychological factors all play a role in their development, and the two conditions share the same clinical and pathophysiological characteristics. On the basis of their many similarities, these two conditions have been considered recently to be part of the same nosologic continuum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following clinical features are essential for a definite diagnosis:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)the predominant symptom is that one or more episodes of awakening from sleep begin with a panicky scream, and are characterized by intense anxiety, body motility, and autonomic hyperactivity, such as tachycardia, rapid breathing, dilated pupils, and sweating;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)these repeated episodes typically last 1-10 minutes and usually occur during the first third of nocturnal sleep;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">(c)there is relative unresponsiveness to efforts of others to influence the sleep terror event and such efforts are almost invariably followed by at least several minutes of disorientation and perseverative movements;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(d)recall of the event, if any, is minimal (usually limited to one or two fragmentary mental images);</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(e)there is no evidence of a physical disorder, such as brain tumour or epilepsy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Sleep terrors should be differentiated from nightmares. The latter are the common &quot;bad dreams&quot; with limited, if any, vocalization and body motility. In contrast to sleep terrors, nightmares occur at any time of the night, and the individual is quite easy to arouse and has a very detailed and vivid recall of the event.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In differentiating sleep terrors from epileptic seizures, the physician should keep in mind that seizures very seldom occur only during the night; an abnormal clinical EEG, however, favours the diagnosis of epilepsy.</p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F51.5 Nightmares</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nightmares are dream experiences loaded with anxiety or fear, of which the individual has very detailed recall. The dream experiences are extremely vivid and usually include themes involving threats to survival, security, or self-esteem. Quite often there is a recurrence of the same or similar frightening nightmare themes. During a typical episode there is a degree of autonomic discharge but no appreciable vocalization or body motility. Upon awakening, the individual rapidly becomes alert and oriented. He or she can fully communicate with others, usually giving a detailed account of the dream experience both immediately and the next morning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In children, there is no consistently associated psychological disturbance, as childhood nightmares are usually related to a specific phase of emotional development. In contrast, adults with nightmares are often found to have significant psychological disturbance, usually in the form of a personality disorder. The use of certain psychotropic drugs such as reserpine, thioridazine, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines has also been found to contribute to the occurrence of nightmares. Moreover, abrupt withdrawal of drugs such as</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, which suppress REM sleep (the stage of sleep related to dreaming), may lead to enhanced dreaming and nightmare through REM rebound.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 27pt;text-align: left;">The following clinical features are essential for a definite diagnosis: (a)awakening from nocturnal sleep or naps with detailed and vivid recall of</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">intensely frightening dreams, usually involving threats to survival, security,</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or self-esteem; the awakening may occur at any time during the sleep period, but typically during the second half;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)upon awakening from the frightening dreams, the individual rapidly becomes oriented and alert;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)the dream experience itself, and the resulting disturbance of sleep, cause marked distress to the individual.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">dream anxiety disorder</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">It is important to differentiate nightmares from sleep terrors.

There may be lack of interest, lack of enjoyment, failure of the physiological responses necessary for effective sexual interaction (e.g. erection), or inability to control or experience orgasm.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: left;">Sexual response is a psychosomatic process; and both psychological and somatic processes are usually involved in the causation of sexual dysfunction. It may be possible to identify an unequivocal psychogenic or organic etiology, but more commonly, particularly with such problems as erectile failure or dyspareunia, it is difficult to ascertain the relative importance of psychological and/or organic factors. In such cases, it is appropriate to categorize the condition as being of either mixed or uncertain etiology.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 33pt;text-align: left;">Some types of dysfunction (e.g. lack of sexual desire) occur in both men and women. Women, however, tend to present more commonly with complaints about the subjective quality of the sexual experience (e.g. lack of enjoyment or interest) rather than failure of a specific response. The complaint of orgasmic dysfunction is not unusual, but when one aspect of a women&#39;s sexual response is affected, others are also likely to be impaired. For example, if a woman is unable to experience orgasm, she will often find herself unable to enjoy other aspects of lovemaking and will thus lose much of her sexual appetite. Men, on the other hand, though complaining of failure of a specific response such as erection or ejaculation, often report a continuing sexual appetite. It is therefore necessary to look beyond the presenting complaint to find the most appropriate diagnostic category.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">Dhat syndrome (F48.8) koro (F48.8)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.0 Lack or loss of sexual desire</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Loss of sexual desire is the principal problem and is not secondary to other sexual difficulties, such as erectile failure or dyspareunia. Lack of sexual desire does not preclude sexual enjoyment or arousal, but makes the initiation of sexual activity less likely.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">frigidity</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 94pt;text-align: left;">hypoactive sexual desire disorder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">F52.1 Sexual aversion and lack of sexual enjoyment F52.10 Sexual aversion</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The prospect of sexual interaction with a partner is associated with strong negative feelings and produces sufficient fear or anxiety that sexual activity is avoided.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.11 Lack of sexual enjoyment</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sexual responses occur normally and orgasm is experienced but there is a lack of appropriate pleasure.

If erection occurs normally in certain situations, e.g. during masturbation or sleep or with a different partner, the causation is likely to be psychogenic. Otherwise, the correct diagnosis of nonorganic erectile dysfunction may depend on special investigations (e.g. measurement of nocturnal penile tumescence) or the response to psychological treatment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In women, the principal problem is vaginal dryness or failure of lubrication. The cause can be psychogenic or pathological (e.g. infection) or estrogen deficiency (e.g. postmenopausal). It is unusual for women to complain primarily of vaginal dryness except as a symptom of postmenopausal estrogen deficiency.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">female sexual arousal disorder</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">male erectile disorder psychogenic impotence</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.3 Orgasmic dysfunction</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Orgasm either does not occur or is markedly delayed. This may be situational (i.e. occur only in certain situations), in which case etiology is likely to be psychogenic, or invariable, when physical or constitutional factors cannot be easily excluded except by a positive response to psychological treatment. Orgasmic dysfunction is more common in women than in men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">inhibited orgasm (male) (female) psychogenic anorgasmy</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.4 Premature ejaculation</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">The inability to control ejaculation sufficiently for both partners to enjoy sexual interaction. In severe cases, ejaculation may occur before vaginal entry or in the absence of an erection. Premature ejaculation is unlikely to be of organic origin but can occur as a psychological reaction to organic impairment, e.g. erectile failure or pain. Ejaculation may also appear to be premature if erection requires prolonged stimulation, causing the time interval between satisfactory erection and ejaculation to be shortened; the primary problem in such a case is delayed erection.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.5 Nonorganic vaginismus</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Spasm of the muscles that surround the vagina, causing occlusion of the vaginal opening.

It can often be attributed to a local pathological condition and should then be appropriately categorized. In some cases, however, no obvious cause is apparent and emotional factors may be important. This category is to be used only if there is no other more primary sexual dysfunction (e.g. vaginismus or vaginal dryness).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">psychogenic dyspareunia</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.7 Excessive sexual drive</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Both men and women may occasionally complain of excessive sexual drive as a problem is its own right, usually during late teenage or early adulthood. When the excessive sexual drive is secondary to an affective disorder (F30-F39) or when it occurs during the early stages of dementia (F00-F03), the underlying disorder should be coded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">nymphomania</span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">satyriasis</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.8 Other sexual dysfunction, not caused by organic disorder or disease</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F52.9 Unspecified sexual dysfunction, not caused by organic disorder or disease</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -33pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">F53 Mental and behavioural disorders associated with the puerperium, not elsewhere classified</p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">This classification should be used only for mental disorders associated with the puerperium (commencing within 6 weeks of delivery) that do not meet the criteria for disorders classified elsewhere in this book, either because insufficient information is available, or because it is considered that special additional clinical features are present which make classification elsewhere inappropriate.

Although the medication may have been medically prescribed or recommended in the first instance, prolonged, unnecessary, and often excessive dosage develops, which is facilitated by the availability of the substances without medical prescription.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Persistent and unjustified use of these substances is usually associated with unnecessary expense, often involves unnecessary contacts with medical professionals or supporting staff, and is sometimes marked by the harmful physical effects of the substances. Attempts to discourage or forbid the use of the substances are often met with resistance; for laxatives and analgesics this may be in spite of warnings about (or even the development of) physical problems such as renal dysfunction or electrolyte disturbances. Although it is usually clear that the patient has a strong motivation to take the substance, there is no development of dependence (F1<span class="s18">x.</span>2) or withdrawal symptoms (F1<span

0pt;text-align: left;">This block includes a variety of clinically significant conditions and behaviour patterns which tend to be persistent and are the expression of an individual&#39;s characteristic lifestyle and mode of relating to self and others. Some of these conditions and patterns of behaviour emerge early in the course of individual development, as a result of both constitutional factors and social experience, while others are acquired later in life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">F60-F62 Specific personality disorders, mixed and other personality disorders, and enduring personality changes</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These types of condition comprise deeply ingrained and enduring behaviour patterns, manifesting themselves as inflexible responses to a broad range of personal and social situations. They represent either extreme or significant deviations from the way the average individual in a given culture perceives, thinks, feels, and particularly relates to others. Such behaviour patterns tend to be stable and to encompass multiple domains of behaviour and psychological functioning. They are frequently, but not always, associated with various degrees of subjective distress and problems in social functioning and performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Personality disorders differ from personality change in their timing and the mode of their emergence: they are developmental conditions, which appear in childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. They are not secondary to another mental disorder or brain disease, although they may precede and coexist with other disorders. In contrast, personality change is acquired, usually during adult life, following severe or prolonged stress, extreme environmental deprivation, serious psychiatric disorder, or brain disease or injury (see F07.-).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Each of the conditions in this group can be classified according to its predominant behavioural manifestations. However, classification in this area is currently limited to the description of a series of types and subtypes, which are not mutually exclusive and which overlap in some of their characteristics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Personality disorders are therefore subdivided according to clusters of traits that correspond to the most frequent or conspicuous behavioural manifestations. The subtypes so described are widely recognized as major forms of personality deviation. In making a diagnosis of personality disorder, the clinician should consider all aspects of personal functioning, although the diagnostic formulation, to be simple and efficient, will refer to only those dimensions or traits for which the suggested thresholds for severity are reached.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The assessment should be based on as many sources of information as possible. Although it is sometimes possible to evaluate a personality condition in a single interview with the patient, it is often necessary to have more than one interview and to collect history data from informants.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cyclothymia and schizotypal disorders were formerly classified with the personality disorders but are now listed elsewhere (cyclothymia in F30-F39 and schizotypal disorder in F20-F29), since they seem to have many aspects in common with the other disorders in those blocks (e.g. phenomena, family history).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The subdivision of personality change is based on the cause or antecedent of such change, i.e. catastrophic experience, prolonged stress or strain, and psychiatric illness (excluding residual schizophrenia, which is classified under F20.5).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is important to separate personality conditions from the disorders included in other categories of this book. If a personality condition precedes or follows a time-limited or chronic psychiatric disorder, both should be diagnosed. Use of</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the multiaxial format accompanying the core classification of mental disorders and psychosocial factors will facilitate the recording of such conditions and disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cultural or regional variations in the manifestations of personality conditions are important, but specific knowledge in this area is still scarce. Personality conditions that appear to be frequently recognized in a given part of the world but do not correspond to any one of the specified subtypes below may be classified as &quot;other&quot; personality disorders and identified through a five-character code provided in an adaptation of this classification for that particular country or region. Local variations in the manifestations of a personality disorder may also be reflected in the wording of the diagnostic guidelines set for such conditions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F60 Specific personality disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A specific personality disorder is a severe disturbance in the characterological constitution and behavioural tendencies of the individual, usually involving several areas of the personality, and nearly always associated with considerable personal and social disruption. Personality disorder tends to appear in late childhood or adolescence and continues to be manifest into adulthood. It is therefore unlikely that the diagnosis of personality disorder will be appropriate before the age of 16 or 17 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General diagnostic guidelines applying to all personality disorders are presented below; supplementary descriptions are provided with each of the subtypes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conditions not directly attributable to gross brain damage or disease, or to another psychiatric disorder, meeting the following criteria:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)markedly disharmonious attitudes and behaviour, involving usually several areas of functioning, e.g. affectivity, arousal, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking, and style of relating to others;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)the abnormal behaviour pattern is enduring, of long standing, and not limited to episodes of mental illness;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)the abnormal behaviour pattern is pervasive and clearly maladaptive to a broad range of personal and social situations;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(d)the above manifestations always appear during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(e)the disorder leads to considerable personal distress but this may only become apparent late in its course;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(f)the disorder is usually, but not invariably, associated with significant problems in occupational and social performance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For different cultures it may be necessary to develop specific sets of criteria with regard to social norms, rules and obligations.

These diagnoses should be made only when there is evidence of a definite and enduring change in a person&#39;s pattern of perceiving, relating to, or thinking about the environment and the self. The personality change should be significant and associated with inflexible and maladaptive behaviour which was not present before the pathogenic experience. The change should not be a manifestation of another mental disorder, or a residual symptom of any antecedent mental disorder.

It may be difficult to differentiate between an acquired personality change and the unmasking or exacerbation of an existing personality disorder following stress, strain, or psychotic experience. Enduring personality change should be diagnosed only when the change represents a permanent and different way of being, which can be etiologically traced back to a profound, existentially extreme experience.The diagnosis should not be made if the personality disorder is secondary to brain damage or disease (category F07.0 should be used instead).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: -53pt;text-align: left;">Excludes:<span class="p">personality and behavioural disorder due to brain disease, damage and dysfunction (F07.-)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l47"><ol id="l48"><li style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s17" style="display: inline;">Enduring personality change after catastrophic experience</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Enduring personality change may follow the experience of catastrophic stress. The stress must be so extreme that it is unnecessary to consider personal vulnerability in order to explain its profound effect on the personality. Examples include concentration camp experiences, torture, disasters, prolonged exposure to life-threatening circumstances (e.g. hostage situations - prolonged captivity with an imminent possibility of being killed). Post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1) may precede this type of personality change, which may then be seen as a chronic, irreversible sequel of stress disorder. In other instances, however, enduring personality change meeting the description given below may develop without an interim phase of a manifest post-traumatic stress disorder. However, long- term change in personality following short-term exposure to a life- threatening experience such as a car accident should <span class="s18">not </span>be included in this category, since recent research indicates that such a development depends on a pre-existing psychological vulnerability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The personality change should be enduring and manifest as inflexible and maladaptive features leading to an impairment in interpersonal, social, and occupational functioning.

There should be no evidence of a pre-existing personality disorder that can explain the personality change, and the diagnosis should not be based on any residual symptoms of the antecedent mental disorder. The change in personality develops following clinical recovery from a mental disorder that must have been experienced as emotionally extremely stressful and shattering to the patient&#39;s self-image. Other people&#39;s attitudes or reactions to the patient following the illness are important in determining and reinforcing his or her perceived level of stress. This type of personality change cannot be fully understood without taking into consideration the subjective emotional experience and the previous personality, its adjustment, and its specific vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic evidence for this type of personality change should include such clinical features as the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l50"><li style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><p style="display: inline;">excessive dependence on and a demanding attitude towards others; (b)conviction of being changed or stigmatized by the preceding illness, leading to an inability to form and maintain close and confiding</p></li></ol></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">personal relationships and to social isolation;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">(c)passivity, reduced interests, and diminished involvement in leisure activities;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(d)persistent complaints of being ill, which may be associated with hypochondriacal claims and illness behaviour;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(e)dysphoric or labile mood, not due to the presence of a current mental disorder or antecedent mental disorder with residual affective symptoms;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(f)significant impairment in social and occupational functioning compared with the premorbid situation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above manifestations must have been present over a period of 2 or more years.

They are characterized by repeated acts that have no clear rational motivation and that generally harm the patient&#39;s own interests and those of other people. The patient reports that the behaviour is associated with impulses to action that cannot be controlled. The causes of these conditions are not understood; the disorders are grouped together because of broad descriptive similarities, not because they are known to share any other important features.

Although some effort at concealment is usually made, not all the opportunities for this are taken. The theft is a solitary act, not carried out with an accomplice. The individual may express anxiety, despondency, and guilt between episodes of stealing from shops (or other premises) but this does not prevent repetition.

There is a persistent preoccupation with the dress and/or activities of the opposite sex and/or repudiation of the patient&#39;s own sex. These disorders are thought to be relatively uncommon and should not be confused with the much more frequent nonconformity wit stereotypic sex- role behaviour. The diagnosis of gender identify disorder in childhood requires a profound disturbance of the normal sense of maleness or femaleness; mere &#39;tomboyishness&#39; in girls or &#39;girlish&#39; behaviour in boys is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">not sufficient. The diagnosis cannot be made when the individual has reached puberty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 19pt;text-align: left;">Because gender identity disorder of childhood has many features in common with the other identity disorders in this section, it has been classified in F64.- rather than in F90 - F98.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The essential diagnostic feature is the child&#39;s pervasive and persistent desire to be (or insistence that he or she is of) the opposite sex to that assigned, together with an intense rejection of the behaviour, attributes, and/or attire of the assigned sex. Typically, this is first manifest during the preschool years; for the diagnosis to be made, the disorder must have been apparent before puberty. In both sexes, there may be repudiation of the anatomical structures of their own sex, but this is an uncommon, probably rare, manifestation. Characteristically, children with a gender identity disorder deny being disturbed by it, although they may be distressed by the conflict with the expectations of their family or peers and by the teasing and/or rejection to which they may be subjected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">More is known about these disorders in boys than in girls. Typically, from the preschool years onwards, boys are preoccupied with types of play and other activities stereotypically associated with females, and there may often be a preference for dressing in girls&#39; or women&#39;s clothes. However, such cross-dressing does not cause sexual excitement (unlike fetishistic transvestism in adults (F65.1)). They may have a very strong desire to participate in the games and pastimes of girls, female dolls are often their favourite toys, and girls are regularly their preferred playmates. Social ostracism tends to arise during the early years of schooling and is often at a peak in middle childhood, with humiliating teasing by other boys. Grossly feminine behaviour may lessen during early adolescence but follow-up studies indicate that between one-third and two-thirds of boys with gender identity disorder of childhood show a homosexual orientation during and after adolescence. However, very few exhibit transsexualism in adult life (although most adults with transsexualism report having had a gender identity problem in childhood).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In clinic samples, gender identity disorders are less frequent in girls than in boys, but it is not known whether this sex ratio applies in the general population. In girls, as in boys, there is usually an early manifestation of a preoccupation with behaviour stereotypically associated with the opposite sex. Typically, girls with these disorders have male companions and show an avid interest in sports and rough-and-tumble play; they lack interest in dolls and in taking female roles in make-believe games such as &quot;mothers and fathers&quot; or playing &quot;house&quot;. Girls with a gender identity disorder tend not to experience the same degree of social ostracism as boys, although they may suffer from teasing in later childhood or adolescence. Most give up an exaggerated insistence on male activities and attire as they approach</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">adolescence, but some retain a male identification and go on to show a homosexual orientation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rarely, a gender identity disorder may be associated with a persistent repudiation of the anatomic structures of the assigned sex. In girls, this may be manifest by repeated assertions that they have, or will grow, a penis, by rejection of urination in the sitting position, or by the assertion that they do not want to grow breasts or to menstruate. In boys, it may be shown by repeated assertions that they will grow up physically to become a woman, that penis and testes are disgusting or will disappear, and/or that it would be better not to have a penis or testes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">egodystonic sexual orientation (F66.1) sexual maturation disorder (F66.0)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F64.8 Other gender identity disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F64.9 Gender identity disorder, unspecified</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">gender-role disorder NOS</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65 Disorders of sexual preference</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">paraphilias</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">problems associated with sexual orientation (F66.-)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.0 Fetishism</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Reliance on some non-living object as a stimulus for sexual arousal and sexual gratification. Many fetishes are extensions of the human body, such as articles of clothing or footware. Other common examples are characterized by some particular texture such as rubber, plastic, or leather. Fetish objects vary in their importance to the individual: in some cases they serve simply to enhance sexual excitement achieved in ordinary ways (e.g. having the partner wear a particular garment).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fetishism should be diagnosed only if the fetish is the most important source of sexual stimulation or essential for satisfactory sexual response.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fetishistic fantasies are common, but they do not amount to a disorder unless they lead to rituals that are so compelling and unacceptable as to interfere with sexual intercourse and cause the individual distress.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fetishism is limited almost exclusively to males.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.1 Fetishistic transvestism</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The wearing of clothes of the opposite sex principally to obtain sexual excitement.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">The disorder is to be distinguished from simple fetishism in that the fetishistic articles of clothing are not only worn, but worn also to create the appearance of a person of the opposite sex. Usually more than one article is worn and often a complete outfit, plus wig and makeup. Fetishistic transvestism is distinguished from transsexual transvestism by its clear association with sexual arousal and the strong desire to remove the clothing once orgasm occurs and sexual arousal declines. A history of fetishistic transvestism is commonly reported as an earlier phase by transsexuals and probably represents a stage in the development of transsexualism in such cases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">transvestic fetishism.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.2 Exhibitionism</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">A recurrent or persistent tendency to expose the genitalia to strangers (usually of the opposite sex) or to people in public places, without inviting or intending closer contact. There is usually, but not invariably, sexual excitement at the time of the exposure and the act is commonly followed by masturbation. This tendency may be manifest only at times of emotional stress or crises, interspersed with long periods without such overt behaviour.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Exhibitionism is almost entirely limited to heterosexual males who expose to females, adult or adolescent, usually confronting them from a safe distance in some public place. For some, exhibitionism is their only sexual outlet, but others continue the habit simultaneously with an active sex life within long-standing relationships, although their urges may become more pressing at times of conflict in those relationships. Most exhibitionists find their urges difficult to control and ego-alien. If the witness appears shocked, frightened, or impressed, the exhibitionist&#39;s excitement is often heightened.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.3 Voyeurism</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">A recurrent or persistent tendency to look at people engaging in sexual or intimate behaviour such as undressing. This usually leads to sexual excitement and masturbation and is carried out without the observed people being aware.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.4 Paedophilia</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A sexual preference for children, usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age. Some paedophiles are attracted only to girls, others only to boys, and others again are interested in both sexes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Paedophilia is rarely identified in women. Contacts between adults and sexually mature adolescents are socially disapproved, especially if the participants are of the same sex, but are not necessarily associated with paedophilia. An isolated incident, especially if the perpetrator is himself an adolescent, does not establish the presence of the persistent or predominant tendency required for the diagnosis. Included among paedophiles, however, are men who retain a preference for adult sex partners but, because they are chronically frustrated in achieving appropriate contacts, habitually turn to children as substitutes. Men who sexually molest their own prepubertal children occasionally approach other children as well, but in either case their behaviour is indicative of paedophilia.</p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.5 Sadomasochism</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">A preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation. If the individual prefers to be the recipient of such stimulation this is called masochism; if the provider, sadism. Often an individual obtains sexual excitement from both sadistic and masochistic activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mild degrees of sadomasochistic stimulation are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity. This category should be used only if sadomasochistic activity is the most important source of stimulation or necessary for sexual gratification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sexual sadism is sometimes difficult to distinguish from cruelty in sexual situations or anger unrelated to eroticism. Where violence is necessary for erotic arousal, the diagnosis can be clearly established.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: -67pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">masochism sadism</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.6 Multiple disorders of sexual preference</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sometimes more than one disorder of sexual preference occurs in one person and none has clear precedence. The most common combination is fetishism, transvestism, and sadomasochism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.8 Other disorders of sexual preference</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">A variety of other patterns of sexual preference and activity may occur, each being relatively uncommon. These include such activities as making obscene telephone calls, rubbing up against people for sexual stimulation in crowded public places (frotteurism), sexual activity with animals, use of strangulation or anoxia for intensifying sexual excitement, and a preference for partners with some particular anatomical abnormality such as an amputated limb.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">Erotic practices are too diverse and many too rare or idiosyncratic to justify a separate term for each. Swallowing urine, smearing faeces, or piercing foreskin or nipples may be part of the behavioural repertoire in sadomasochism. Masturbatory rituals of various kinds are common, but the more extreme practices, such as the insertion of objects into the rectum or penile urethra, or partial self-strangulation, when they take the place of ordinary sexual contacts, amount to abnormalities. Necrophilia should also be coded here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">frotteurism necrophilia</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F65.9 Disorder of sexual preference, unspecified</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">sexual deviation NOS</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">F66 Psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Note: <span class="p">Sexual orientation alone is not to be regarded as a disorder.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following five-character codes may be used to indicate variations of sexual development or orientation that may be problematic for the individual:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 193%;text-align: left;">F66.<span class="s18">x</span>0 Heterosexual F66.<span class="s18">x</span>1 Homosexual</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F66.<span class="s18">x</span>2 Bisexual</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">To be used only when there is clear evidence of sexual attraction to members of both sexes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F66.<span class="s18">x</span>8 Other, including prepubertal</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F66.0 Sexual maturation disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The individual suffers from uncertainty about his or her gender identity or sexual orientation, which causes anxiety or depression.

An attention-seeking (histrionic) behavioural syndrome develops, which may also contain additional (and usually nonspecific) complaints that are not of physical origin. The patient is commonly distressed by this pain or disability and is often preoccupied with worries, which may be justified, of the possibility of prolonged or progressive disability or pain. Dissatisfaction with the result of treatment or investigations, or disappointment with the amount of personal attention received in wards and clinics may also be a motivating factor. Some cases appear to be clearly motivated by the possibility of financial compensation following accidents or injuries, but the syndrome does not necessarily resolve rapidly even after successful litigation.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="s12">compensation neurosis</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">F68.1 Intentional production or feigning of symptoms or disabilities, either physical or psychological [factitious disorder]</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">In the absence of a confirmed physical or mental disorder, disease, or disability, the individual feigns symptoms repeatedly and consistently. For physical symptoms this may even extend to self-infliction of cuts or abrasions to produce bleeding, or to self-injection of toxic substances.The imitation of pain and the insistence upon the presence of bleeding may be so convincing and persistent that repeated investigations and operations are performed at several different hospitals or clinics, in spite of repeatedly negative findings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">The motivation for this behaviour is almost always obscure and presumably internal, and the condition is best interpreted as a disorder of illness behaviour and the sick role.

Retardation can occur with or without any other mental or physical disorder. However, mentally retarded individuals can experience the full range of mental disorders, and the prevalence of other mental disorders is at least three to four times greater in this population than in the general population. In addition, mentally retarded individuals are at greater risk of exploitation and physical/sexual abuse. Adaptive behaviour is always impaired, but in protected social environments where support is available this impairment may not be at all obvious in subjects with mild mental retardation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A fourth character may be used to specify the extent of the behavioural impairment, if this is not due to an associated disorder:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">F7<span class="s18">x</span>.0 No, or minimal, impairment of behaviour</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F7<span class="s18">x</span>.1 Significant impairment of behaviour requiring attention or treatment F7<span class="s18">x</span>.8 Other impairments of behaviour</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">F7<span class="s18">x</span>.9 Without mention of impairment of behaviour</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the cause of the mental retardation is known, an additional code from ICD-10 should be used (e.g. F72 severe mental retardation plus E00.- (congenital</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">iodine-deficiency syndrome)).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The presence of mental retardation does not rule out additional diagnoses coded elsewhere in this book. However, communication difficulties are likely to make it necessary to rely more than usual for the diagnosis upon objectively observable symptoms such as, in the case of a depressive episode, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and weight, and sleep disturbance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intelligence is not a unitary characteristic but is assessed on the basis of a large number of different, more-or-less specific skills. Although the general tendency is for all these skills to develop to a similar level in each individual, there can be large discrepancies, especially in persons who are mentally retarded. Such people may show severe impairments in one particular area (e.g. language), or may have a particular area of higher skill (e.g. in simple visuo-spatial tasks) against a background of severe mental retardation. This presents problems when determining the diagnostic category in which a retarded person should be classified. The assessment of intellectual level should be based on whatever information is available, including clinical findings, adaptive behaviour (judged in relation to the individual&#39;s cultural background), and psychometric test performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For a definite diagnosis, there should be a reduced level of intellectual functioning resulting in diminished ability to adapt to the daily demands of the normal social environment. Associated mental or physical disorders have a major influence on the clinical picture and the use made of any skills. The diagnostic category chosen should therefore be based on global assessments of ability and not on any single area of specific impairment or skill. The IQ levels given are provided as a guide and should not be applied rigidly in view of the problems of cross-cultural validity. The categories given below are arbitrary divisions of a complex continuum, and cannot be defined with absolute precision. The IQ should be determined from standardized, individually administered intelligence tests for which local cultural norms have been determined, and the test selected should be appropriate to the individual&#39;s level of functioning and additional specific handicapping conditions, e.g. expressive language problems, hearing impairment, physical involvement. Scales of social maturity and adaptation, again locally standardized, should be completed if at all possible by interviewing a parent or care-provider who is familiar with the individual&#39;s skills in everyday life. Without the use of standardized procedures, the diagnosis must be regarded as a provisional estimate only.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F70 Mild mental retardation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mildly retarded people acquire language with some delay but most achieve the ability to use speech for everyday purposes, to hold conversations, and to engage in the clinical interview. Most of them also achieve full independence in self-care (eating, washing, dressing, bowel and bladder control) and in practical and domestic skills, even if the rate of development is considerably slower than normal. The main difficulties are usually seen in academic school work, and many have particular problems in reading and writing. However, mildly retarded people can be greatly helped by education designed to develop their skills and compensate for their handicaps. Most of those in the higher ranges of mild mental retardation are potentially capable of work demanding practical rather than academic abilities, including unskilled or semiskilled manual labour. In a sociocultural context requiring little academic achievement, some degree of mild retardation may not itself represent a problem. However, if there is also noticeable emotional and social immaturity, the consequences of the handicap, e.g. inability to cope with the demands of marriage or</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">child-rearing, or difficulty fitting in with cultural traditions and expectations, will be apparent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In general, the behavioural, emotional, and social difficulties of the mildly mentally retarded, and the needs for treatment and support arising from them, are more closely akin to those found in people of normal intelligence than to the specific problems of the moderately and severely retarded. An organic etiology is being identified in increasing proportions of patients, although not yet in the majority.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the proper standardized IQ tests are used, the range 50 to 69 is indicative of mild retardation. Understanding and use of language tend to be delayed to a varying degree, and executive speech problems that interfere with the development of independence may persist into adult life. An organic etiology is identifiable in only a minority of subjects. Associated conditions such as autism, other developmental disorders, epilepsy, conduct disorders, or physical disability are found in varying proportions. If such disorders are present, they should be coded independently.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">feeble-mindedness</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mild mental subnormality mild oligophrenia</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">moron</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F71 Moderate mental retardation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Individuals in this category are slow in developing comprehension and use of language, and their eventual achievement in this area is limited.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Achievement of self-care and motor skills is also retarded, and some need supervision throughout life. Progress in school work is limited, but a proportion of these individuals learn the basic skills needed for reading, writing, and counting. Educational programmes can provide opportunities for them to develop their limited potential and to acquire some basic skills; such programmes are appropriate for slow learners with a low ceiling of achievement. As adults, moderately retarded people are usually able to do simple practical work, if the tasks are carefully structured and skilled supervision is provided. Completely independent living in adult life is rarely achieved. Generally, however, such people are fully mobile and physically active and the majority show evidence of social development in their ability to establish contact, to communicate with others, and to engage in simple social activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The IQ is usually in the range 35 to 49. Discrepant profiles of abilities are common in this group, with some individuals achieving higher levels in visuo-spatial skills than in tasks dependent on language, while others are markedly clumsy but enjoy social interaction and simple conversation.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The level of development of language is variable: some of those affected can take part in simple conversations while others have only enough language to communicate their basic needs. Some never learn to use language, though they may understand simple instructions and may learn to use manual signs to compensate to some extent for their speech disabilities. An organic etiology can be identified in the majority of moderately mentally retarded people. Childhood autism or other pervasive developmental disorders are present in a substantial minority, and have a major effect upon the clinical picture and the type of management needed. Epilepsy, and neurological and physical disabilities are also common,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">although most moderately retarded people are able to walk without assistance. It is sometimes possible to identify other psychiatric conditions, but the limited level of language development may make diagnosis difficult and dependent upon information obtained from others who are familiar with the individual. Any such associated disorders should be coded independently.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">imbecility</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">moderate mental subnormality moderate oligophrenia</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F72 Severe mental retardation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This category is broadly similar to that of moderate mental retardation in terms of the clinical picture, the presence of an organic etiology, and the associated conditions.

0pt;line-height: 27pt;text-align: left;">The disorders included in F80-F89 have the following features in common: (a)an onset that is invariably during infancy or childhood;</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">(b)an impairment or delay in the development of functions that are strongly</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">related to biological maturation of the central nervous system; and</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)a steady course that does not involve the remissions and relapses that tend to be characteristic of many mental disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In most cases, the functions affected include language, visuo-spatial skills and/or motor coordination.  It is characteristic for the impairments to lessen progressively as children grow older (although milder deficits often remain in adult life).</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Usually, the history is of a delay or impairment that has been present from as early as it could be reliably detected, with no prior period of normal development.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most of these conditions are several times more common in boys than in girls.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is characteristic of developmental disorders that a family history of similar or related disorders is common, and there is presumptive evidence that genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of many (but not all) cases.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Environmental factors often influence the developmental functions affected but in most cases they are not of paramount influence. However, although there is generally good agreement on the overall conceptualization of disorders in this section, the etiology in most cases is unknown and there is continuing uncertainty regarding both the boundaries and the precise subdivisions of developmental disorders. Moreover, two types of condition are included in this block that do not entirely meet the broad conceptual definition outlined above. First, there are disorders in which there has been an undoubted phase of prior normal development, such as the childhood disintegrative disorder, the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and some cases of autism. These conditions are included because, although their onset is different, their characteristics and course have many similarities with the group of developmental disorders; moreover it is not known whether or not they are etiologically distinct. Second, there are disorders that are defined primarily in terms of <span class="s18">deviance </span>rather than delay in developmental functions; this applies especially to autism. Autistic disorders are included in this block because, although defined in terms of deviance, developmental delay of some degree is almost invariable. Furthermore, there is overlap with the other developmental disorders in terms of both the features of individual cases and familiar clustering.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F80 Specific developmental disorders of speech and language</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These are disorders in which normal patterns of language acquisition are disturbed from the early stages of development. The conditions are not directly attributable to neurological or speech mechanism abnormalities, sensory impairments, mental retardation, or environmental factors. The child may be better able to communicate or understand in certain very</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">familiar situations than in others, but language ability in every setting is impaired.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">As with other developmental disorders, the first difficulty in diagnosis concerns the differentiation from normal variations in development. Normal children vary widely in the age at which they first acquire spoken language and in the pace at which language skills become firmly established. Such normal variations are of little or no clinical significance, as the great majority of &quot;slow speakers&quot; go on to develop entirely normally. In sharp contrast, children with specific developmental disorders of speech and language, although most ultimately acquire a normal level of language skills, have multiple associated problems. Language delay is often followed by difficulties in reading and spelling, abnormalities in interpersonal relationships, and emotional and behavioural disorders. Accordingly, early and accurate diagnosis of specific developmental disorders of speech and language is important. There is no clear-cut demarcation from the extremes of normal variation, but four main criteria are useful in suggesting the occurrence of a clinically significant disorder: severity, course, pattern, and associated problems.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a general rule, a language delay that is sufficiently severe to fall outside the limits of 2 standard deviations may be regarded as abnormal.  Most cases of this severity have associated problems.  The level of severity in statistical terms is of less diagnostic use in older children, however, because there is a natural tendency towards progressive improvement.  In this situation the course provides a useful indicator.  If the current level of impairment is mild but there is nevertheless a history of a previously severe degree of impairment, the likelihood is that the current functioning represents the sequelae of a significant disorder rather than just normal variation.  Attention should be paid to the pattern of speech and language functioning; if the pattern is abnormal (i.e. deviant and not just of a kind appropriate for an earlier phase of development), or if the child&#39;s speech or language includes qualitatively abnormal features, a clinically significant disorder is likely.  Moreover, if a delay in some specific aspect of speech or language development is accompanied by scholastic deficits (such as specific retardation in reading or spelling), by abnormalities in interpersonal relationships, and/or by emotional or behavioural disturbance, the delay is unlikely to constitute just a normal variation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The second difficulty in diagnosis concerns the differentiation from mental retardation or global developmental delay. Because intelligence includes verbal skills, it is likely that a child whose IQ is substantially below average will also show language development that is somewhat below average.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis of a specific developmental disorder implies that the specific delay is significantly out of keeping with the general level of cognitive functioning. Accordingly, when a language delay is simply part of a more pervasive mental retardation or global developmental delay, a mental retardation coding (F70-F79) should be used, <span class="s18">not </span>an F80.- coding.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, it is common for mental retardation to be associated with an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">uneven pattern of intellectual performance and especially with a degree of language impairment that is more severe than the retardation in nonverbal skills. When this disparity is of such a marked degree that it is evident in everyday functioning, a specific developmental disorder of speech and language should be coded <span class="s18">in addition to </span>a coding for mental retardation (F70-F79).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The third difficulty concerns the differentiation from a disorder secondary to severe deafness or to some specific neurological or other structural abnormality. Severe deafness in early childhood will almost always lead to a marked delay and distortion of language development; such conditions should <span class="s18">not </span>be included here, as they are a direct consequence of the hearing impairment. However, it is not uncommon for the more severe developmental disorders of receptive language to be accompanied by partial selective hearing impairments (especially of high frequencies). The guideline is to <span class="s18">exclude </span>these disorders from F80-F89 if the severity of hearing loss constitutes a sufficient explanation for the language delay, but to <span class="s18">include </span>them if partial hearing loss is a complicating factor but not a sufficient direct cause. However, a hard and fast distinction is impossible to make. A similar principle applies with respect to neurological abnormalities and structural defects. Thus, an articulation abnormality directly due to a cleft palate or to a dysarthria resulting from cerebral palsy would be excluded from this block. On the other hand, the presence of subtle neurological abnormalities that could not have directly caused the speech or language delay would not constitute a reason for exclusion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F80.0 Specific speech articulation disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A specific developmental disorder in which the child&#39;s use of speech sounds is below the appropriate level for his or her mental age, but in which there is a normal level of language skills.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The age of acquisition of speech sounds, and the order in which these sounds develop, show considerable individual variation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Normal development<span class="p">. At the age of 4 years, errors in speech sound production are common, but the child is able to be understood easily by strangers.

By the age of 11-12 years, mastery of almost all speech sounds should be acquired.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Abnormal development <span class="p">occurs when the child&#39;s acquisition of speech sounds is delayed and/or deviant, leading to: misarticulations in the child&#39;s speech with consequent difficulties for others in understanding him or her; omissions, distortions, or substitutions of speech sounds; and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">inconsistencies in the co-occurrence of sounds (i.e. the child may produce phonemes correctly in some word positions but not in others).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis should be made only when the severity of the articulation disorder is outside the limits of normal variation for the child&#39;s mental age; nonverbal intelligence is within the normal range; expressive and receptive language skills are within the normal range; the articulation abnormalities are not directly attributable to a sensory, structural or neurological abnormality; and the mispronunciations are clearly abnormal in the context of colloquial usage in the child&#39;s subculture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: -67pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">developmental articulation disorder developmental phonological disorder dyslalia</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">functional articulation disorder lalling</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="p">: articulation disorder due to:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">aphasia NOS (R47.0) apraxia (R48.2)</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">articulation impairments associated with a developmental</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: left;">disorder of expressive or receptive language (F80.1, F80.2) cleft palate or other structural abnormalities of the oral</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: left;">structures involved in speech (Q35-Q38) hearing loss (H90-H91)</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mental retardation (F70-F79)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F80.1    Expressive language disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A specific developmental disorder in which the child&#39;s ability to use expressive spoken language is markedly below the appropriate level for his or her mental age, but in which language comprehension is within normal limits.

Later difficulties include: restricted vocabulary development; overuse of a small set of general words, difficulties in selecting appropriate words, and word substitutions; short utterance length; immature sentence structure; syntactical errors, especially <span class="s18">omissions </span>of word endings or prefixes; and misuse of or failure to use grammatical features such as prepositions, pronouns, articles, and verb and noun inflexions. Incorrect overgeneralizations of rules may also occur, as may a lack of sentence fluency and difficulties in sequencing when recounting past events.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is frequent for impairments in spoken language to be accompanied by delays or abnormalities in word-sound production.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis should be made only when the severity of the delay in the development of expressive language is outside the limits of normal variation for the child&#39;s mental age, but receptive language skills are within normal limits (although may often be somewhat below average). The use of nonverbal cues (such as smiles and gesture) and &quot;internal&quot; language as reflected in imaginative or make-believe play should be relatively intact, and the ability to communicate socially without words should be relatively unimpaired. The child will seek to communicate in spite of the language impairment and will tend to compensate for lack of speech by use of demonstration, gesture, mime, or non-speech vocalizations. However, associated difficulties in peer relationships, emotional disturbance, behavioural disruption, and/or overactivity and inattention are not uncommon, particularly in school-age children. In a minority of cases there may be some associated partial (often selective) hearing loss, but this should not be of a severity sufficient to account for the language delay.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inadequate involvement in conversational interchanges, or more general environmental privation, may play a major or contributory role in the impaired development of expressive language. Where this is the case, the environmental causal factor should be noted by means of the appropriate Z code from Chapter XXI of ICD-10.The impairment in spoken language should have been evident from infancy without any clear prolonged phase of normal language usage. However, a history of apparently normal first use of a <span class="s18">few </span>single words, followed by a setback or failure to progress, is not uncommon.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">developmental dysphasia or aphasia, expressive type</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="p">: acquired aphasia with epilepsy [Landau-Kleffner syndrome] (F80.3)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">developmental aphasia or dysphasia, receptive type (F80.2) dysphasia and aphasia NOS (R47.0)</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">elective mutism (F94.0) mental retardation (F70-F79)</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pervasive developmental disorders (F84.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F80.2    Receptive language disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A specific developmental disorder in which the child&#39;s understanding of language is below the appropriate level for his or her mental age.

Of all the varieties of specific developmental disorders of speech and language, this has the highest rate of associated</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">socio-emotional-behavioural disturbance. Such disturbances do not take any specific form, but hyperactivity and inattention, social ineptness and isolation from peers, and anxiety, sensitivity, or undue shyness are all relatively frequent. Children with the most severe forms of receptive language impairment may be somewhat delayed in their social development, may echo language that they do not understand, and may show somewhat restricted interest patterns. However, they differ from autistic children in usually showing normal social reciprocity, normal make-believe play, normal use of parents for comfort, near-normal use of gesture, and only mild impairments in nonverbal communication. Some degree of high-frequency hearing loss is not infrequent, but the degree of deafness is not sufficient to account for the language impairment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">congenital auditory imperception</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">developmental aphasia or dysphasia, receptive type developmental Wernicke&#39;s aphasia</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">word deafness</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="p">: acquired aphasia with epilepsy [Landau-Kleffner syndrome] (F80.3)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(F80.1)</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">autism (F84.0, F84.1)</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dysphasia and aphasia, NOS (R47.0) or expressive type</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">elective mutism (F94.0)</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">language delay due to deafness (H90-H91) mental retardation (F70-F79)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F80.3 Acquired aphasia with epilepsy [Landau-Kleffner syndrome]</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A disorder in which the child, having previously made normal progress in language development, loses both receptive and expressive language skills but retains general intelligence. Onset of the disorder is accompanied by paroxysmal abnormalities on the EEG (almost always from the temporal lobes, usually bilateral, but often with more widespread disturbance), and in the majority of cases also by epileptic seizures. Typically the onset is between the ages of 3 and 7 years but the disorder can arise earlier or later in childhood. In a quarter of cases the loss of language occurs gradually over a period of some months, but more often the loss is abrupt, with skills being lost over days or weeks. The temporal association between onset of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">seizures and loss of language is rather variable, with either one preceding the other by a few months to 2 years. It is highly characteristic that the impairment of receptive language is profound, with difficulties in auditory comprehension often being the first manifestation of the condition. Some children become mute, some are restricted to jargon-like sounds, and some show milder deficits in word fluency and output often accompanied by misarticulations. In a few cases voice quality is affected, with a loss of normal inflexions. Sometimes language functions appear fluctuating in the early phases of the disorder. Behavioural and emotional disturbances are quite common in the months after the initial language loss, but they tend to improve as the child acquires some means of communication.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The etiology of the condition is not known but the clinical characteristics suggest the possibility of an inflammatory encephalitic process.

These are disorders in which the normal patterns of skill acquisition are disturbed from the early stages of development. They are not simply a consequence of a lack of opportunity to learn, nor are they due to any form of acquired brain trauma or disease. Rather, the disorders are thought to stem from abnormalities in cognitive processing that derive largely from some type of biological dysfunction. As with most other</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">developmental disorders, the conditions are substantially more common in boys than in girls.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Five kinds of difficulty arise in diagnosis. First, there is the need to differentiate the disorders from normal variations in scholastic achievement. The considerations are similar to those in language disorders, and the same criteria are proposed for the assessment of abnormality (with the necessary modifications that arise from evaluation of scholastic achievement rather than language). Second, there is the need to take developmental course into account. This is important for two different reasons:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l53"><li style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Severity: the significance of one year&#39;s retardation in reading at age 7 years is quite different from that of one year&#39;s retardation at 14 years.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Change in pattern: it is common for a language delay in the preschool years to resolve so far as spoken language is concerned but to be followed by a specific reading retardation which, in turn, diminishes in adolescence; the principal problem remaining in early adulthood is a severe spelling disorder. The condition is the same throughout but the pattern alters with increasing age; the diagnostic criteria need to take into account this developmental change.</p></li></ol></li></ol></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third, there is the difficulty that scholastic skills have to be taught and learned: they are <span class="s18">not </span>simply a function of biological maturation. Inevitably a child&#39;s level of skills will depend on family circumstances and schooling, as well as on his or her own individual characteristics. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward and unambiguous way of differentiating scholastic difficulties due to lack of adequate experiences from those due to some individual disorder. There are good reasons for supposing that the distinction is real and clinically valid but the diagnosis in individual cases is difficult. Fourth, although research findings provide support for the hypothesis of underlying abnormalities in cognitive processing, there is no easy way in the individual child to differentiate those that <span class="s18">cause </span>reading difficulties from those that derive from or are associated with poor reading skills. The difficulty is compounded by the finding that reading disorders may stem from more than one type of cognitive abnormality. Fifth, there are continuing uncertainties over the best way of subdividing the specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Children learn to read, write, spell, and perform arithmetical computations when they are introduced to these activities at home and at school.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Countries vary widely in the age at which formal schooling is started, in the syllabus followed within schools, and hence in the skills that children are expected to have acquired by different ages. This disparity of expectations is greater during elementary or primary school years (i.e. up to age about 11 years) and complicates the issue of devising operational definitions of disorders of scholastic skills that have cross-national validity.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, within all education settings, it is clear that each chronological age group of schoolchildren contains a wide spread of scholastic attainments and that some children are underachieving in specific aspects of attainment relative to their general level of intellectual functioning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills (SDDSS) comprise groups of disorders manifested by specific and significant impairments in learning of scholastic skills. These impairments in learning are not the direct result of other disorders (such as mental retardation, gross neurological deficits, uncorrected visual or auditory problems, or emotional disturbances), although they may occur concurrently with such conditions. SDDSS frequently occur in conjunction with other clinical syndromes (such as attention deficit disorder or conduct disorder) or other developmental disorders (such as specific developmental disorder of motor function or specific developmental disorders of speech and language).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The etiology of SDDSS is not known, but there is an assumption of the primacy of biological factors which interact with nonbiological factors (such as opportunity for learning and quality of teaching) to produce the manifestations. Although these disorders are related to biological maturation, there is no implication that children with these disorders are simply at the lower end of a normal continuum and will therefore &quot;catch up&quot; with time. In many instances, traces of these disorders may continue through adolescence into adulthood. Nevertheless, it is a necessary diagnostic feature that the disorders were manifest in some form during the early years of schooling. Children can fall behind in their scholastic performance at a later stage in their educational careers (because of lack of interest, poor teaching, emotional disturbance, an increase or change in pattern of task demands, etc.), but such problems do not form part of the concept of SDDSS.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are several basic requirements for the diagnosis of any of the specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills. First, there must be a clinically significant degree of impairment in the specified scholastic skill. This may be judged on the basis of severity as defined in scholastic terms (i.e. a degree that may be expected to occur in less than 3% of schoolchildren); on developmental precursors (i.e. the scholastic difficulties were preceded by developmental delays or deviance - most often in speech or language - in the preschool years); on associated problems (such as inattention, overactivity, emotional disturbance, or conduct difficulties); on pattern (i.e. the presence of qualitative abnormalities that are not usually part of normal development); and on response (i.e. the scholastic difficulties do not rapidly and readily remit with increased help at home and/or at school).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Second, the impairment must be specific in the sense that it is not solely explained by mental retardation or by lesser impairments in general intelligence. Because IQ and scholastic achievement do not run exactly in parallel, this distinction can be made only on the basis of individually administered standardized tests of achievement and IQ that are appropriate for the relevant culture and educational system. Such tests should be used in connection with statistical tables that provide data on the average expected level of achievement for any given IQ level at any given chronological age. This last requirement is necessary because of the importance of statistical regression effects: diagnoses based on subtractions of achievement age from mental age are bound to be seriously misleading. In routine clinical practice, however, it is unlikely that these requirements will be met in most instances. Accordingly, the clinical guideline is simply that the child&#39;s level of attainment must be very substantially below that expected for a child of the same mental age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Third, the impairment must be developmental, in the sense that it must have been present during the early years of schooling and not acquired later in the educational process. The history of the child&#39;s school progress should provide evidence on this point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fourth, there must be no external factors that could provide a sufficient reason for the scholastic difficulties. As indicated above, a diagnosis of SDDSS should generally rest on positive evidence of clinically significant disorder of scholastic achievement associated with factors intrinsic to the child&#39;s development. To learn effectively, however, children must have adequate learning opportunities. Accordingly, if it is clear that the poor scholastic achievement is directly due to very prolonged school absence without teaching at home or to grossly inadequate education, the disorders should not be coded here. Frequent absences from school or educational discontinuities resulting from changes in school are usually <span class="s18">not </span>sufficient to give rise to scholastic retardation of the degree necessary for diagnosis of SDDSS. However, poor schooling may complicate or add to the problem, in which case the school factors should be coded by means of a Z code from Chapter XXI of ICD-10.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fifth, the SDDSS must not be <span class="s18">directly </span>due to uncorrected visual or hearing impairments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">It is clinically important to differentiate between SDDSS that arise in the absence of any diagnosable neurological disorder and those that are secondary to some neurological condition such as cerebral palsy. In practice this differentiation is often difficult to make (because of the uncertain significance of multiple &quot;soft&quot; neurological signs), and research findings do not show any clear-cut differentiation in either the pattern or course of SDDSS according to the presence or absence of overt neurological dysfunction. Accordingly, although this does </span>not <span class="p">form part of the diagnostic criteria, it </span>is <span class="p">necessary that the presence of any</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">associated disorder be separately coded in the appropriate neurological section of the classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F81.0 Specific reading disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The main feature of this disorder is a specific and significant impairment in the development of reading skills, which is not solely accounted for by mental age, visual acuity problems, or inadequate schooling. Reading comprehension skill, reading word recognition, oral reading skill, and performance of tasks requiring reading may all be affected. Spelling difficulties are frequently associated with specific reading disorder and often remain into adolescence even after some progress in reading has been made. Children with specific reading disorder frequently have a history of specific developmental disorders of speech and language, and comprehensive assessment of current language functioning often reveals subtle contemporaneous difficulties. In addition to academic failure, poor school attendance and problems with social adjustment are frequent complications, particularly in the later elementary and secondary school years. The condition is found in all known languages, but there is uncertainty as to whether or not its frequency is affected by the nature of the language and of the written script.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The child&#39;s reading performance should be significantly below the level expected on the basis of age, general intelligence, and school placement. Performance is best assessed by means of an individually administered, standardized test of reading accuracy and comprehension. The precise nature of the reading problem depends on the expected level of reading, and on the language and script. However, in the early stages of learning an alphabetic script, there may be difficulties in reciting the alphabet, in giving the correct names of letters, in giving simple rhymes for words, and in analysing or categorizing sounds (in spite of normal auditory acuity).</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Later, there may be errors in oral reading skills such as shown by:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)omissions, substitutions, distortions, or additions of words or parts of words;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) slow reading rate;</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)false starts, long hesitations or &quot;loss of place&quot; in text, and inaccurate phrasing; and</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(d)reversals of words in sentences or of letters within words.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There may also be deficits in reading comprehension, as shown by, for example:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(e)an inability to recall facts read;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(f)inability to draw conclusions or inferences from material read; and (g)use of general knowledge as background information rather than of</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">information from a particular story to answer questions about a story read.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In later childhood and in adult life, it is common for spelling difficulties to be more profound than the reading deficits. It is characteristic that the spelling difficulties often involve phonetic errors, and it seems that both the reading and spelling problems may derive in part from an impairment in phonological analysis. Little is known about the nature or frequency of spelling errors in children who have to read non-phonetic languages, and little is known about the types of error in non-alphabetic scripts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Specific developmental disorders of reading are commonly preceded by a history of disorders in speech or language development. In other cases, children may pass language milestones at the normal age but have difficulties in auditory processing as shown by problems in sound categorization, in rhyming, and possibly by deficits in speech sound discrimination, auditory sequential memory, and auditory association. In some cases, too, there may be problems in visual processing (such as in letter discrimination); however, these are common among children who are just beginning to learn to read and hence are probably not directly causally related to the poor reading. Difficulties in attention, often associated with overactivity and impulsivity, are also common. The precise pattern of developmental difficulties in the preschool period varies considerably from child to child, as does their severity; nevertheless such difficulties are usually (but not invariably) present.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Associated emotional and/or behavioural disturbances are also common during the school-age period.  Emotional problems are more common during the early school years, but conduct disorders and hyperactivity syndromes are most likely to be present in later childhood and adolescence. Low self-esteem is common and problems in school adjustment and in peer relationships are also frequent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">&quot;backward reading&quot;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">developmental dyslexia specific reading retardation</p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">spelling difficulties associated with a reading disorder</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="p">: acquired alexia and dyslexia (R48.0)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">acquired reading difficulties secondary to emotional</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">disturbance</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(F81.1)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(F93.-)</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">spelling disorder not associated with reading difficulties</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F81.1 Specific spelling disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The main feature of this disorder is a specific and significant impairment in the development of spelling skills in the <span class="s18">absence </span>of a history of specific reading disorder, which is not solely accounted for by low mental age, visual acuity problems, or inadequate schooling.

Developmental motor milestones may be delayed and there may be some associated speech difficulties (especially involving articulation).</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The young child may be awkward in general gait, being slow to learn to run, hop, and go up and down stairs. There is likely to be difficulty learning to tie shoe laces, to fasten and unfasten buttons, and to throw and catch balls. The child may be generally clumsy in fine and/or gross movements - tending to drop things, to stumble, to bump into obstacles, and to have poor handwriting. Drawing skills are usually poor, and children with this disorder are often poor at jigsaw puzzles, using constructional toys, building models, ball games, and drawing and understanding maps.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In most cases a careful clinical examination shows marked neurodevelopmental immaturities such as choreiform movements of unsupported limbs, or mirror movements and other associated motor features, as well as signs of poor fine and gross motor coordination (generally described as &quot;soft&quot; neurological signs because of their normal occurrence in younger children and their lack of localizing value).

These qualitative abnormalities are a pervasive feature of the individual&#39;s functioning in all situations, although they may vary in degree. In most cases, development is abnormal from infancy and, with only a few exceptions, the conditions become manifest during the first 5 years of life. It is usual, but not invariable, for there to be some degree of general cognitive impairment but the disorders are defined in terms of <i>behaviour </i>that is deviant in relation to mental age (whether the individual is retarded or not). There is some disagreement on the subdivision of this overall group of pervasive developmental disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">In some cases the disorders are associated with, and presumably due to, some medical condition, of which infantile spasms, congenital rubella, tuberous sclerosis, cerebral lipidosis, and the fragile X chromosome anomaly are among the most common.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">However, the disorder should be diagnosed on the basis of the behavioural features, irrespective of the presence or absence of any associated medical conditions; any such associated condition must, nevertheless, be separately coded. If mental retardation is present, it is important that it too should be separately coded, under F70-F79, because it is not a universal feature of the pervasive developmental disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F84.0 Childhood autism</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A pervasive developmental disorder defined by the presence of abnormal and/or impaired development that is manifest before the age of 3 years, and by the characteristic type of abnormal functioning in all three areas of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviour.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The disorder occurs in boys three to four times more often than in girls.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Usually there is no prior period of unequivocally normal development but, if there is, abnormalities become apparent before the age of 3 years. There are always qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction. These take the form of an inadequate appreciation of socio-emotional cues, as shown by a lack of responses to other people&#39;s emotions and/or a lack of modulation of behaviour according to social context; poor use of social signals and a weak integration of social, emotional, and communicative behaviours; and, especially, a lack of socio-emotional reciprocity.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Similarly, qualitative impairments in communications are universal. These take the form of a lack of social usage of whatever language skills are present; impairment in make-believe and social imitative play; poor synchrony and lack of reciprocity in conversational interchange; poor</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">flexibility in language expression and a relative lack of creativity and fantasy in thought processes; lack of emotional response to other people&#39;s verbal and nonverbal overtures; impaired use of variations in cadence or emphasis to reflect communicative modulation; and a similar lack of accompanying gesture to provide emphasis or aid meaning in spoken communication.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The condition is also characterized by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. These take the form of a tendency to impose rigidity and routine on a wide range of aspects of day-to day functioning; this usually applies to novel activities as well as to familiar habits and play patterns. In early childhood particularly, there may be specific attachment to unusual, typically non-soft objects.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The children may insist on the performance of particular routines in rituals of a nonfunctional character; there may be stereotyped preoccupations with interests such as dates, routes or timetables; often there are motor stereotypies; a specific interest in nonfunctional elements of objects (such as their smell or feel) is common; and there may be a resistance to changes in routine or in details of the personal environment (such as the movement of ornaments or furniture in the family home).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to these specific diagnostic features, it is frequent for children with autism to show a range of other nonspecific problems such as fear/phobias, sleeping and eating disturbances, temper tantrums, and aggression. Self-injury (e.g. by wrist-biting) is fairly common, especially when there is associated severe mental retardation. Most individuals with autism lack spontaneity, initiative, and creativity in the organization of their leisure time and have difficulty applying conceptualizations in decision-making in work (even when the tasks themselves are well within their capacity). The specific manifestation of deficits characteristic of autism change as the children grow older, but the deficits continue into and through adult life with a broadly similar pattern of problems in socialization, communication, and interest patterns. Developmental abnormalities must have been present in the first 3 years for the diagnosis to be made, but the syndrome can be diagnosed in all age groups.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All levels of IQ can occur in association with autism, but there is significant mental retardation in some three-quarters of cases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">autistic disorder</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">infantile autism infantile psychosis Kanner&#39;s syndrome</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Apart from the other varieties of pervasive developmental disorder it is important to consider: specific developmental disorder of receptive language (F80.2) with secondary socio-emotional problems; reactive attachment disorder (F94.1) or disinhibited attachment disorder (F94.2); mental retardation (F70-F79) with some associated</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">emotional/behavioural disorder; schizophrenia (F20.-) of unusually early onset; and Rett&#39;s syndrome (F84.2).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">autistic psychopathy (F84.5)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F84.1 Atypical autism</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A pervasive developmental disorder that differs from autism in terms <span class="s18">either </span>of age of onset <span class="s18">or </span>of failure to fulfil all three sets of diagnostic criteria. Thus, abnormal and/or impaired development becomes manifest for the first time only after age 3 years; and/or there are insufficient demonstrable abnormalities in one or two of the three areas of psychopathology required for the diagnosis of autism (namely, reciprocal social interactions, communication, and restrictive, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour) in spite of characteristic abnormalities in the other area(s). Atypical autism arises most often in profoundly retarded individuals whose very low level of functioning provides little scope for exhibition of the specific deviant behaviours required for the diagnosis of autism; it also occurs in individuals with a severe specific developmental disorder of receptive language. Atypical autism thus constitutes a meaningfully separate condition from autism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">atypical childhood psychosis</span></p><p style="padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mental retardation with autistic features</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F84.2 Rett&#39;s syndrome</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A condition of unknown cause, so far reported only in girls, which has been differentiated on the basis of a characteristic onset, course, and pattern of symptomatology. Typically, apparently normal or near-normal early development is followed by partial or complete loss of acquired hand skills and of speech, together with deceleration in head growth, usually with an onset between 7 and 24 months of age. Hand-wringing stereotypies, hyperventilation and loss of purposive hand movements are particularly characteristic. Social and play development are arrested in the first 2 or 3 years, but social interest tends to be maintained. During middle childhood, trunk ataxia and apraxia, associated with scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis tend to develop and sometimes there are choreoathetoid movements. Severe mental handicap invariably results. Fits frequently develop during early or middle childhood.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In most cases onset is between 7 and 24 months of age. The most characteristic feature is a loss of purposive hand movements and acquired fine motor manipulative skills. This is accompanied by loss, partial loss or lack of development of language; distinctive stereotyped tortuous wringing or &quot;hand-washing&quot; movements, with the arms flexed in front of the chest or chin; stereotypic wetting of the hands with saliva; lack of proper chewing of food; often episodes of hyperventilation; almost always a failure to gain bowel and bladder control; often excessive drooling and protrusion</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the tongue; and a loss of social engagement. Typically, the children retain a kind of &quot;social smile&quot;, looking at or &quot;through&quot; people, but not interacting socially with them in early childhood (although social interaction often develops later). The stance and gait tend to become broad-based, the muscles are hypotonic, trunk movements usually become poorly coordinated, and scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis usually develops.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spinal atrophies, with severe motor disability, develop in adolescence or adulthood in about half the cases. Later, rigid spasticity may become manifest, and is usually more pronounced in the lower than in the upper limbs. Epileptic fits, usually involving some type of minor attack, and with an onset generally before the age of 8 years, occur in the majority of cases. In contrast to autism, both deliberate self-injury and complex stereotyped preoccupations or routines are rare.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Initially, Rett&#39;s syndrome is differentiated primarily on the basis of the lack of purposive hand movements, deceleration of head growth, ataxia, stereotypic &quot;hand-washing&quot; movements, and lack of proper chewing.

This is followed by impoverishment and then loss of speech and language, accompanied by behavioural disintegration. In some cases the loss of skills is persistently progressive (usually when the disorder is associated with a progressive diagnosable neurological condition), but more often the decline over a period of some months is followed by a plateau and then a limited improvement. The prognosis is usually very poor, and most individuals are left with severe mental retardation. There is uncertainty about the extent to which this condition differs from autism. In some cases the disorder can be shown to be due to some associated encephalopathy, but the diagnosis should be made on the behavioural features. Any associated neurological condition should be separately coded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis is based on an apparently normal development up to the age of at least 2 years, followed by a definite loss of previously acquired skills; this is accompanied by qualitatively abnormal social functioning. It is usual for there to be a profound regression in, or loss of, language, a regression in the level of play, social skills, and adaptive behaviour, and often a loss of bowel or bladder control, sometimes with a deteriorating motor control.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Typically, this is accompanied by a general loss of interest in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">environment, by stereotyped, repetitive motor mannerisms, and by an autistic-like impairment of social interaction and communication. In some respects, the syndrome resembles dementia in adult life, but it differs in three key respects: there is usually no evidence of any identifiable organic disease or damage (although organic brain dysfunction of some type is usually inferred); the loss of skills may be followed by a degree of recovery; and the impairment in socialization and communication has deviant qualities typical of autism rather than of intellectual decline.

The category is included here because of the evidence that children with moderate to severe mental retardation (IQ below 50) who exhibit major problems in hyperactivity and inattention frequently show stereotyped behaviours; such children tend not to benefit from stimulant drugs (unlike those with an IQ in the normal range) and may exhibit a severe dysphoric reaction (sometimes with psychomotor retardation) when given stimulants; in adolescence the overactivity tends to be replaced by underactivity (a pattern that is <span class="s18">not </span>usual in hyperkinetic children with normal intelligence). It is also common for the syndrome to be associated with a variety of developmental delays, either specific or global.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The extent to which the behavioural pattern is a function of low IQ or of organic brain damage is not known, neither is it clear whether the disorders in children</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with mild mental retardation who show the hyperkinetic syndrome would be better classified here or under F90.-; at present they are included in F90-.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis depends on the combination of developmentally inappropriate severe overactivity, motor stereotypies, and moderate to severe mental retardation; all three must be present for the diagnosis.

The disorder differs from autism primarily in that there is no general delay or retardation in language or in cognitive development. Most individuals are of normal general intelligence but it is common for them to be markedly clumsy; the condition occurs predominantly in boys (in a ratio of about eight boys to one girl). It seems highly likely that at least some cases represent mild varieties of autism, but it is uncertain whether or not that is so for all. There is a strong tendency for the abnormalities to persist into adolescence and adult life and it seems that they represent individual characteristics that are not greatly affected by environmental influences. Psychotic episodes occasionally occur in early adult life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis is based on the combination of a lack of any clinically significant general delay in language or cognitive development plus, as with autism, the presence of qualitative deficiencies in reciprocal social interaction and restricted, repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. There may or may not be problems in communication similar to those associated with autism, but significant language retardation would rule out the diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align:

0pt;text-align: center;">F90     Hyperkinetic disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This group of disorders is characterized by: early onset; a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behaviour with marked inattention and lack of persistent task involvement; and pervasiveness over situations and persistence over time of these behavioural characteristics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is widely thought that constitutional abnormalities play a crucial role in the genesis of these disorders, but knowledge on specific etiology is lacking at present. In recent years the use of the diagnostic term &quot;attention deficit disorder&quot; for these syndromes has been promoted. It has not been used here because it implies a knowledge of psychological processes that is not yet available, and it suggests the inclusion of anxious, preoccupied, or &quot;dreamy&quot; apathetic children whose problems are probably different. However, it is clear that, from the point of view of behaviour, problems of inattention constitute a central feature of these hyperkinetic syndromes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyperkinetic disorders always arise early in development (usually in the first 5 years of life). Their chief characteristics are lack of persistence in activities that require cognitive involvement, and a tendency to move from one activity to another without completing any one, together with disorganized, ill-regulated, and excessive activity. These problems usually persist through school years and even into adult life, but many affected individuals show a gradual improvement in activity and attention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Several other abnormalities may be associated with these disorders. Hyperkinetic children are often reckless and impulsive, prone to accidents, and find themselves in disciplinary trouble because of unthinking (rather than deliberately defiant) breaches of rules. Their relationships with adults are often socially disinhibited, with a lack of normal caution and reserve; they are unpopular with other children and may become isolated. Cognitive impairment is common, and specific delays in motor and language development are disproportionately frequent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Secondary complications include dissocial behaviour and low self esteem. There is accordingly considerable overlap between hyperkinesis and other patterns of disruptive behaviour such as&quot;unsocialized conduct disorder&quot;. Nevertheless, current evidence favours the separation of a group in which hyperkinesis is the main problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hyperkinetic disorders are several times more frequent in boys than in girls. Associated reading difficulties (and/or other scholastic problems) are common.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cardinal features are impaired attention and overactivity: both are necessary for the diagnosis and should be evident in more than one situation (e.g. home, classroom, clinic).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Impaired attention is manifested by prematurely breaking off from tasks and leaving activities unfinished. The children change frequently from one activity to another, seemingly losing interest in one task because they become diverted to another (although laboratory studies do not generally show an unusual degree of sensory or perceptual distractibility). These deficits in persistence and attention should be diagnosed only if they are excessive for the child&#39;s age and IQ.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overactivity implies excessive restlessness, especially in situations requiring relative calm. It may, depending upon the situation, involve the child running and jumping around, getting up from a seat when he or she was supposed to remain seated, excessive talkativeness and noisiness, or fidgeting and wriggling. The standard for judgement should be that the activity is excessive in the context of what is expected in the situation and by comparison with other children of the same age and IQ. This behavioural feature is most evident in structured, organized situations that require a high degree of behavioural self-control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The associated features are not sufficient for the diagnosis or even necessary, but help to sustain it. Disinhibition in social relationships, recklessness in situations involving some danger, and impulsive flouting of social rules (as shown by intruding on or interrupting others&#39; activities, prematurely answering questions before they have been completed, or difficulty in waiting turns) are all characteristic of children with this disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Learning disorders and motor clumsiness occur with undue frequency, and should be noted separately (under F80-F89) when present; they should not, however, be part of the actual diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Symptoms of conduct disorder are neither exclusion nor inclusion criteria for the main diagnosis, but their presence or absence constitutes the basis for the main subdivision of the disorder (see below).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The characteristic behaviour problems should be of early onset (before age 6 years) and long duration. However, before the age of school entry, hyperactivity is difficult to recognize because of the wide normal variation: only extreme levels should lead to a diagnosis in preschool children.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder can still be made in adult life. The grounds are the same, but attention and activity must be judged with reference to developmentally appropriate norms. When hyperkinesis was present in childhood, but has disappeared and been succeeded by another condition, such as dissocial personality disorder or substance abuse, the current condition rather than the earlier one is coded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Mixed disorders are common, and pervasive developmental disorders take precedence when they are present. The major problems in diagnosis lie in differentiation from conduct disorder: when its criteria are met, hyperkinetic disorder is diagnosed with priority over conduct disorder. However, milder degrees of overactivity and inattention are common in conduct disorder. When features of both hyperactivity and conduct disorder are</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">present, and the hyperactivity is pervasive and severe, &quot;hyperkinetic conduct disorder&quot; (F90.1) should be the diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A further problem stems from the fact that overactivity and inattention, of a rather different kind from that which is characteristic of a hyperkinetic disorder, may arise as a symptom of anxiety or depressive disorders. Thus, the restlessness that is typically part of an agitated depressive disorder should not lead to a diagnosis of a hyperkinetic disorder. Equally, the restlessness that is often part of severe anxiety should not lead to the diagnosis of a hyperkinetic disorder. If the criteria for one of the anxiety disorders (F40.-, F41.-, F43.-, or F93.-) are met, this should take precedence over hyperkinetic disorder unless there is evidence, apart from the restlessness associated with anxiety, for the additional presence of a hyperkinetic disorder. Similarly, if the criteria for a mood disorder (F30-F39) are met, hyperkinetic disorder should not be diagnosed in addition simply because concentration is impaired and there is psychomotor agitation. The double diagnosis should be made only when symptoms that are not simply part of the mood disturbance clearly indicate the separate presence of a hyperkinetic disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Acute onset of hyperactive behaviour in a child of school age is more probably due to some type of reactive disorder (psychogenic or organic), manic state, schizophrenia, or neurological disease (e.g. rheumatic fever).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="p">: anxiety disorders (F41.- or F93.0) mood [affective] disorders (F30-F39)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">pervasive developmental disorders (F84.-) schizophrenia (F20.-)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F90.0 Disturbance of activity and attention</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is continuing uncertainty over the most satisfactory subdivision of hyperkinetic disorders. However, follow-up studies show that the outcome in adolescence and adult life is much influenced by whether or not there is associated aggression, delinquency, or dissocial behaviour. Accordingly, the main subdivision is made according to the presence or absence of these associated features. The code used should be F90.0 when the overall criteria for hyperkinetic disorder (F90.-) are met but those for F91.- (conduct disorders) are not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Includes<span class="p">: attention deficit disorder or syndrome with hyperactivity attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes<span class="p">: hyperkinetic disorder associated with conduct disorder (F90.1)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F90.1 Hyperkinetic conduct disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This coding should be used when both the overall criteria for hyperkinetic disorders (F90.-) <span class="s18">and </span>the overall criteria for conduct disorders (F91.-) are met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F90.8 Other hyperkinetic disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F90.9 Hyperkinetic disorder, unspecified</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This residual category is not recommended and should be used only when there is a lack of differentiation between F90.0 and F90.1 but the overall criteria for F90.- are fulfilled.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">hyperkinetic reaction or syndrome of childhood or adolescence NOS</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F91 Conduct disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conduct disorders are characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of dissocial, aggressive, or defiant conduct. Such behaviour, when at its most extreme for the individual, should amount to major violations of age-appropriate social expectations, and is therefore more severe than ordinary childish mischief or adolescent rebelliousness. Isolated dissocial or criminal acts are not in themselves grounds for the diagnosis, which implies an enduring pattern of behaviour.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Features of conduct disorder can also be symptomatic of other psychiatric conditions, in which case the underlying diagnosis should be coded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disorders of conduct may in some cases proceed to dissocial personality disorder (F60.2). Conduct disorder is frequently associated with adverse psychosocial environments, including unsatisfactory family relationships and failure at school, and is more commonly noted in boys. Its distinction from emotional disorder is well validated; its separation from hyperactivity is less clear and there is often overlap.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Judgements concerning the presence of conduct disorder should take into account the child&#39;s developmental level. Temper tantrums, for example, are a normal part of a 3-year-old&#39;s development and their mere presence would not be grounds for diagnosis. Equally, the violation of other people&#39;s civic rights (as by violent crime) is not within the capacity of most 7-year-olds and so is not a necessary diagnostic criterion for that age group.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Examples of the behaviours on which the diagnosis is based include the following: excessive levels of fighting or bullying; cruelty to animals or other people; severe destructiveness to property; fire-setting; stealing; repeated lying; truancy from school and running away from home; unusually frequent and severe temper tantrums; defiant provocative behaviour; and persistent severe disobedience. Any one of these categories, if marked, is sufficient for the diagnosis, but isolated dissocial acts are not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exclusion criteria include uncommon but serious underlying conditions such as schizophrenia, mania, pervasive developmental disorder, hyperkinetic disorder, and depression.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This diagnosis is not recommended unless the duration of the behaviour described above has been 6 months or longer.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">Conduct disorder overlaps with other conditions.

The disorder requires that the overall criteria for F91 be met; even severely disturbed parent-child relationships are not of themselves sufficient for diagnosis.  There may be stealing from the home, often specifically focused on the money or possessions of one or two particular individuals.  This may be accompanied by deliberately destructive behaviour, again often focused on  specific family members - such as breaking of toys or ornaments, tearing of clothes, carving on furniture, or destruction of prized possessions.  Violence against family members (but not others) and deliberate fire-setting confined to the home are also grounds for the diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis requires that there be no significant conduct disturbance outside the family setting <span class="s18">and </span>that the child&#39;s social relationships outside the family be within the normal range.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In most cases these family-specific conduct disorders will have arisen in the context of some form of marked disturbance in the child&#39;s relationship with one or more members of the nuclear family. In some cases, for example, the disorder may have arisen in relation to conflict with a newly arrived step-parent. The nosological validity of this category remains uncertain, but it is possible that these highly situation-specific conduct disorders do not carry the generally poor prognosis associated with pervasive conduct disturbances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F91.1 Unsocialized conduct disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This type of conduct disorder is characterized by the combination of persistent dissocial or aggressive behaviour (meeting the overall criteria for F91 and not merely comprising oppositional, defiant, disruptive behaviour), with a significant pervasive abnormality in the individual&#39;s relationships with other children.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The lack of effective integration into a peer group constitutes the key distinction from &quot;socialized&quot; conduct disorders and this has precedence over all other differentiations.  Disturbed peer relationships are evidenced chiefly by isolation from and/or rejection by or unpopularity with other children, and by a lack of close friends or of lasting empathic, reciprocal relationships with others in the same age group.  Relationships with adults tend to be marked by discord, hostility, and resentment.  Good relationships with adults can occur (although usually they lack a close, confiding quality) and, if present, do <span class="s18">not  </span>rule out the diagnosis.  Frequently, but not always, there is some associated emotional disturbance (but, if this is of a degree sufficient to meet the criteria of a mixed disorder, the code F92.- should be used).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Offending is characteristically (but not necessarily) solitary. Typical behaviours comprise: bullying, excessive fighting, and (in older children) extortion or violent assault; excessive levels of disobedience, rudeness, uncooperativeness, and resistance to authority; severe temper tantrums and uncontrolled rages; destructiveness to property, fire-setting, and cruelty to animals and other children. Some isolated children, however, become involved in group offending. The nature of the offence is therefore less important in making the diagnosis than the quality of personal relationships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The disorder is usually pervasive across situations but it may be most evident at school; specificity to situations other than the home is compatible with the diagnosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">conduct disorder, solitary aggressive type unsocialized aggressive disorder</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">F91.2    Socialized conduct disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This category applies to conduct disorders involving persistent dissocial or aggressive behaviour (meeting the overall criteria for F91 and not merely comprising oppositional, defiant, disruptive behaviour) occurring in individuals who are generally well integrated into their peer group.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The key differentiating feature is the presence of adequate, lasting friendships with others of roughly the same age. Often, but not always, the peer group will consist of other youngsters involved in delinquent or dissocial activities (in which case the child&#39;s socially unacceptable conduct may well be approved by the peer group and regulated by the subculture to which it belongs). However, this is not a necessary requirement for the diagnosis: the child may form part of a</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">non-delinquent peer group with his or her dissocial behaviour taking place outside this context. If the dissocial behaviour involves bullying in particular, there may be disturbed relationships with victims or some other children. Again, this does not invalidate the diagnosis provided that the child has some peer group to which he or she is loyal and which involves lasting friendships.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relationships with adults in authority tend to be poor but there may be good relationships with others. Emotional disturbances are usually minimal. The conduct disturbance may or may not include the family setting but if it is confined to the home the diagnosis is excluded.

It is defined by the <span class="s18">presence </span>of markedly defiant, disobedient, provocative behaviour and by the <span class="s18">absence </span>of more severe dissocial or aggressive acts that violate the law or the rights of others. The disorder requires that the overall criteria for F91 be met: even severely mischievous or naughty behaviour is not in itself sufficient for diagnosis. Many authorities consider that oppositional defiant patterns of behaviour represent a less severe type of conduct disorder, rather than a qualitatively distinct type. Research evidence is lacking on whether the distinction is qualitative or quantitative. However, findings suggest that, in so far as it is distinctive, this is true mainly or only in younger children. Caution should be employed in using this category, especially in the case of older children. Clinically significant conduct disorders in older children are usually accompanied by dissocial or aggressive behaviour that go beyond defiance, disobedience, or disruptiveness, although, not infrequently, they are preceded by oppositional defiant disorders at an earlier age. The category is included to reflect common diagnostic practice and to facilitate the classification of disorders occurring in young children.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The essential feature of this disorder is a pattern of persistently negativistic, hostile, defiant, provocative, and disruptive behaviour, which is clearly outside the normal range of behaviour for a child of the same age in the same sociocultural context, and which does not include the more serious violations of the rights of others as reflected in the aggressive and dissocial behaviour specified for categories F91.0 and F91.2. Children with this disorder tend frequently and actively to defy adult requests or rules and deliberately to annoy other people. Usually they tend to be angry, resentful, and easily annoyed by other people whom they blame for their own mistakes or difficulties. They generally have a low frustration tolerance and readily lose their temper. Typically, their defiance has a provocative quality, so that they initiate confrontations and generally exhibit excessive levels of rudeness, uncooperativeness, and resistance to authority.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frequently, this behaviour is most evident in interactions with adults or peers whom the child knows well, and signs of the disorder may not be evident during a clinical interview.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">The key distinction from other types of conduct disorder is the <span class="s18">absence </span>of</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">behaviour that violates the law and the basic rights of others, such as theft, cruelty, bullying, assault, and destructiveness. The definite presence of any of the above would exclude the diagnosis. However, oppositional defiant behaviour, as outlined in the paragraph above, is often found in other types of conduct disorder. If another type (F91.0-F91.2) is present, it should be coded in preference to oppositional defiant disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -68pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">conduct disorders including overtly dissocial or aggressive behaviour (F91.0-F91.2)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F91.8 Other conduct disorders</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F91.9 Conduct disorder, unspecified</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This residual category is not recommended and should be used only for disorders that meet the general criteria for F91 but that have not been specified as to subtype or that do not fulfil the criteria for any of the specified subtypes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">childhood behavioural disorder NOS childhood conduct disorder NOS</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F92 Mixed disorders of conduct and emotions</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This group of disorders is characterized by the combination of persistently aggressive, dissocial, or defiant behaviour with overt and marked symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other emotional upsets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The severity should be sufficient that the criteria for both conduct disorders of childhood (F91.-) and emotional disorders of childhood (F93.-), or for an adult-type neurotic disorder (F40-49) or mood disorder (F30-39) are met.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insufficient research has been carried out to be confident that this category should indeed be separate from conduct disorders of childhood.

There have been four main justifications for this differentiation. First, research findings have been consistent in showing that the majority of children with emotional disorders go on to become normal adults: only a minority show neurotic disorders in adult life. Conversely, many adult neurotic disorders appear to have an onset in adult life without significant psychopathological precursors in childhood. Hence there is considerable discontinuity between emotional disorders occurring in these two age periods. Second, many emotional disorders in childhood seem to constitute exaggerations of normal developmental trends rather than phenomena that are qualitatively abnormal in themselves. Third, related to the last consideration, there has often been the theoretical assumption that the mental mechanisms involved in emotional disorders of childhood may not be the same as for adult neuroses. Fourth, the emotional disorders of childhood are less clearly demarcated into supposedly specific entities such as phobic disorders or obsessional disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The third of these points lacks empirical validation, and epidemiological data suggest that, if the fourth is correct, it is a matter of degree only (with poorly differentiated emotional disorders quite common in both childhood and adult life). Accordingly, the second feature (i.e. developmental appropriateness) is used as the key diagnostic feature in defining the difference between the emotional disorders with an onset specific to childhood (F93.-) and the neurotic disorders (F40-F49). The validity of this distinction is uncertain, but there is some empirical evidence to suggest that the developmentally appropriate emotional disorders of childhood have a better prognosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F93.0 Separation anxiety disorder of childhood</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is normal for toddlers and preschool children to show a degree of anxiety over real or threatened separation from people to whom they are attached. Separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed only when fear over separation constitutes</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the focus of the anxiety and when such anxiety arises during the early years. It is differentiated from normal separation anxiety when it is of such severity that is statistically unusual (including an abnormal persistence beyond the usual age period) and when it is associated with significant problems in social functioning. In addition, the diagnosis requires that there should be no generalized disturbance of personality development of functioning; if such a disturbance is present, a code from F40-F49 should be considered. Separation anxiety that arises at a developmentally inappropriate age (such as during adolescence) should not be coded here unless it constitutes an abnormal continuation of developmentally appropriate separation anxiety.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The key diagnostic feature is a focused excessive anxiety concerning separation from those individuals to whom the child is attached (usually parents or other family members), that is not merely part of a generalized anxiety about multiple situations. The anxiety may take the form of:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(a)an unrealistic, preoccupying worry about possible harm befalling major attachment figures or a fear that they will leave and not return;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)an unrealistic, preoccupying worry that some untoward event, such as the child being lost, kidnapped, admitted to hospital, or killed, will separate him or her from a major attachment figure;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)persistent reluctance or refusal to go to school because of fear about separation (rather than for other reasons such as fear about events at school);</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(d)persistent reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near or next to a major attachment figure;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(e)persistent inappropriate fear of being alone, or otherwise without the major attachment figure, at home during the day;</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(f)repeated nightmares about separation;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(g)repeated occurrence of physical symptoms (nausea, stomachache, headache, vomiting, etc.) on occasions that involve separation from a major attachment figure, such as leaving home to go to school;</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">(h)excessive, recurrent distress (as shown by anxiety, crying, tantrums, misery, apathy, or social withdrawal) in anticipation of, during, or immediately following separation from a major attachment figure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many situations that involve separation also involve other potential stressors or sources of anxiety. The diagnosis rests on the demonstration that the common element giving rise to anxiety in the various situations is the circumstance of separation from a major attachment figure. This arises most commonly, perhaps, in relation to school refusal (or &quot;phobia&quot;). Often, this does represent separation anxiety but sometimes (especially in adolescence) it does not. School refusal arising for the first time in adolescence should not be coded here unless it is primarily a function of separation anxiety, and that anxiety was first evident to an abnormal degree during the preschool years. Unless those criteria are met, the syndrome should be coded in one of the other categories in F93 or under</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F40-F48.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">mood [affective] disorders (F30-F39) neurotic disorders (F40-F48)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">phobic anxiety disorder of childhood (F93.1) social anxiety disorder of childhood (F93.2)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F93.1 Phobic anxiety disorder of childhood</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Children, like adults, can develop fear that is focused on a wide range of objects or situations.

In severe cases this may be accompanied by overt hostility, physical trauma and/or maliciousness towards, and undermining of, the sibling. In lesser cases, it may be shown by a strong reluctance to share, a lack of positive regard, and a paucity of friendly interactions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The emotional disturbance may take any of several forms, often including some regression with loss of previously acquired skills (such as bowel or bladder control) and a tendency to babyish behaviour. Frequently, too, the child wants to copy the baby in activities that provide for parental attention, such as feeding.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is usually an increase in confrontational or oppositional behaviour with the parents, temper tantrums, and dysphoria exhibited in the form of anxiety, misery, or social withdrawal.

Serious environmental distortions or privations are commonly associated and are thought to play a crucial etiological role in many instances. There is no marked sex differential. The existence of this group of disorders of social functioning is well recognized, but there is uncertainty regarding the defining diagnostic criteria, and also disagreement regarding the most appropriate subdivision and classification.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F94.0 Elective mutism</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The condition is characterized by a marked, emotionally determined selectivity in speaking, such that the child demonstrates his or her language competence in some situations but fails to speak in other (definable) situations. Most frequently, the disorder is first manifest in early childhood; it occurs with approximately the same frequency in the two sexes, and it is usual for the mutism to be associated with marked personality features involving social anxiety, withdrawal, sensitivity, or resistance. Typically, the child speaks at home or with close friends and is mute at school or with strangers, but other patterns (including the converse) can occur.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The diagnosis presupposes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a)a normal, or near-normal, level of language comprehension;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)a level of competence in language expression that is sufficient for social communication;</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(c)demonstrable evidence that the individual can and does speak normally or almost normally in some situations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, a substantial minority of children with elective mutism have a history of either some speech delay or articulation problems. The diagnosis may be made in the presence of such problems provided that there is adequate language for effective communication and a <span class="s18">gross </span>disparity in language usage according to the social context, such that the child speaks fluently in some situations but is mute or near-mute in others. There should also be demonstrable failure to speak in some social situations but not in others. The diagnosis requires that the failure to speak is persistent over time and that there is a consistency and predictability with respect to the situations in which speech does and does not occur.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Other socio-emotional disturbances are present in the great majority of cases but they do not constitute part of the necessary features for diagnosis.

Fearfulness and hypervigilance that do not respond to comforting are characteristic, poor social interaction with peers is typical, aggression towards the self and others is very frequent, misery is usual, and growth failure occurs in some cases. The syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect, abuse, or serious mishandling. The existence of this behavioural pattern is well recognized and accepted, but there is continuing uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria to be applied, the boundaries of the syndrome, and whether the syndrome constitutes a valid nosological entity. However, the category is included here because of the public health importance of the syndrome, because there is no doubt of its existence, and because the behavioural pattern clearly does not fit the criteria of other diagnostic categories.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The key feature is an abnormal pattern of relationships with care-givers that developed before the age of 5 years, that involves maladaptive features not ordinarily seen in normal children, and that is persistent yet reactive to sufficiently marked changes in patterns of rearing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Young children with this syndrome show strongly contradictory or ambivalent social responses that may be most evident at times of partings and reunions.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thus, infants may approach with averted look, gaze strongly away while being held, or respond to care-givers with a mixture of approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting.  The emotional disturbance may be evident in apparent misery, a lack of emotional responsiveness, withdrawal reactions such as huddling on the floor, and/or aggressive responses to their own or others&#39; distress.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fearfulness and hypervigilance (sometimes described as &quot;frozen watchfulness&quot;) that are unresponsive to comforting occur in some cases. In most cases, the children show interest in peer interactions but social play is impeded by negative emotional responses. The attachment disorder may also be accompanied by a failure to thrive physically and by impaired physical growth (which should be coded according to the appropriate somatic category (R62)).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Many normal children show insecurity in the pattern of their selective attachment to one or other parent, but this should not be confused with the reactive attachment disorder which differs in several crucial respects. The disorder is characterized by an abnormal type of insecurity shown in markedly contradictory</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">social responses not ordinarily seen in normal children. The abnormal responses extend across different social situations and are not confined to a dyadic relationship with a particular care-giver; there is a lack of responsiveness to comforting; and there is associated emotional disturbance in the form of apathy, misery, or fearfulness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Five main features differentiate this condition from pervasive developmental disorders. First, children with a reactive attachment disorder have a normal capacity for social reciprocity and responsiveness, whereas those with a pervasive developmental disorder do not. Second, although the abnormal patterns of social responses in a reactive attachment disorder are initially a general feature of the child&#39;s behaviour in a variety of situations, they remit to a major degree if the child is placed in a normal rearing environment that provides continuity in responsive care-giving. This does not occur with pervasive developmental disorders. Third, although children with reactive attachment disorders may show impaired language development (of the type described under F80.1), they do not exhibit the abnormal qualities of communication characteristic of autism. Fourth, unlike autism, reactive attachment disorder is not associated with persistent and severe cognitive deficits that do not respond appreciably to environmental change. Fifth, persistently restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities are not a feature of reactive attachment disorders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reactive attachment disorders nearly always arise in relation to grossly inadequate child care. This may take the form of psychological abuse or neglect (as evidenced by harsh punishment, persistent failure to respond to the child&#39;s overtures, or grossly inept parenting), or of physical abuse or neglect (as evidenced by persistent disregard of the child&#39;s basic physical needs, repeated deliberate injury, or inadequate provision of nutrition). Because there is insufficient knowledge of the consistency of association between inadequate child care and the disorder, the presence of environmental privation and distortion is not a diagnostic requirement. However, there should be caution in making the diagnosis in the absence of evidence of abuse or neglect. Conversely, the diagnosis should not be made automatically on the basis of abuse or neglect: not all abused or neglected children manifest the disorder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">Asperger&#39;s syndrome (F84.5)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood (F94.2) maltreatment syndromes, resulting in physical problems (T74) normal variation in pattern of selective attachment</p><p style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: left;">sexual or physical abuse in childhood, resulting in psychosocial problems (Z61.4-Z61.6)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F94.2 Disinhibited attachment disorder of childhood</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A particular pattern of abnormal social functioning that arises during the first 5 years of life and that, having become established, shows a tendency to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances. At age about 2 years it is usually manifest by clinging and diffuse, non-selectively focused attachment behaviour. By age 4 years, diffuse attachments remain but clinging tends to be replaced by attention-seeking and indiscriminately friendly behaviour. In middle</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and later childhood, individuals may or may not have developed selective attachments but attention-seeking behaviour often persists, and poorly modulated peer interactions are usual; depending on circumstances, there may also be associated emotional or behavioural disturbance. The syndrome has been most clearly identified in children reared in institutions from infancy but it also occurs in other situations; it is thought to be due in part to a persistent failure of opportunity to develop selective attachments as a consequence of extremely frequent changes in care-givers. The conceptual unity of the syndrome depends on the early onset of diffuse attachments, continuing poor social interactions, and lack of situation-specificity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnosis should be based on evidence that the child showed an unusual degree  of diffuseness in selective attachments during the first 5 years <span class="s18">and </span>that this was associated with generally clinging behaviour in infancy and/or indiscriminately friendly, attention-seeking behaviour in early or middle childhood.

A tic is an involuntary, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic motor movement (usually involving circumscribed muscle groups), or vocal production, that is of sudden onset and serves no apparent purpose. Tics tend to be experienced as irresistible but they can usually be suppressed for varying periods of time. Both motor and vocal tics may be classified as either simple or complex, although the boundaries are not well defined. Common simple motor tics include eye-blinking,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">neck-jerking, shoulder-shrugging, and facial grimacing. Common simple vocal tics include throat-clearing, barking, sniffing, and hissing. Common complex tics include hitting one&#39;s self, jumping, and hopping. Common complex vocal tics include the repetition of particular words, and sometimes the use of socially unacceptable (often obscene) words (coprolalia), and the repetition of one&#39;s own sounds or words (palilalia).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is immense variation in the severity of tics. At the one extreme the phenomenon is near-normal, with perhaps 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 children showing transient tics at some time. At the other extreme, Tourette&#39;s syndrome is an uncommon, chronic, incapacitating disorder. There is uncertainty about whether these extremes represent different conditions or are opposite ends of the same continuum; many authorities regard the latter as more likely. Tic disorders are substantially more frequent in boys than in girls and a family history of tics is common.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The major features distinguishing tics from other motor disorders are the sudden, rapid, transient, and circumscribed nature of the movements, together with the lack of evidence of underlying neurological disorder; their repetitiveness; (usually) their disappearance during sleep; and the ease with which they may be voluntarily reproduced or suppressed. The lack of rhythmicity differentiates tics from the stereotyped repetitive movements seen in some cases of autism or of mental retardation. Manneristic motor activities seen in the same disorders tend to comprise more complex and variable movements than those usually seen with tics. Obsessive- compulsive activities sometimes resemble complex tics but differ in that their form tends to be defined by their purpose (such as touching some object or turning a number of times) rather than by the muscle groups involved; however, the differentiation is sometimes difficult.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tics often occur as an isolated phenomenon but not infrequently they are associated with a wide variety of emotional disturbances, especially, perhaps, obsessional and hypochondriacal phenomena. However, specific developmental delays are also associated with tics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no clear dividing line between tic disorder with some associated emotional disturbance and an emotional disorder with some associated tics. However, the diagnosis should represent the major type of abnormality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F95.0 Transient tic disorder</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meets the general criteria for a tic disorder, but tics do not persist for longer than 12 months. This is the commonest form of tic and is most frequent about the age of 4 or 5 years; the tics usually take the form of eye-blinking, facial grimacing, or head-jerking. In some cases the tics occur as a single episode but in other cases there are remissions and relapses over a period of months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F95.1 Chronic motor or vocal tic disorder</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meets the general criteria for a tic disorder, in which there are motor or vocal tics (but not both); tics may be either single or multiple (but usually multiple), and last for more than a year.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F95.2 Combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder [de la Tourette&#39;s syndrome]</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A form of tic disorder in which there are, or have been, multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics, although these need not have occurred concurrently.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Onset is almost always in childhood or adolescence. A history of motor tics before development of vocal tics is common; the symptoms frequently worsen during adolescence, and it is common for the disorder to persist into adult life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The vocal tics are often multiple with explosive repetitive vocalizations, throat-clearing, and grunting, and there may be the use of obscene words or</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">phrases. Sometimes there is associated gestural echopraxia, which also may be of an obscene nature (copropraxia).

The enuresis may have been present from birth (i.e. an abnormal extension of the normal infantile incontinence) or it may have arisen following a period of acquired</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bladder control. The later onset (or secondary) variety usually begins about the age of 5 to 7 years. The enuresis may constitute a monosymptomatic condition or it may be associated with a more widespread emotional or behavioural disorder.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the latter case there is uncertainty over the mechanisms involved in the association.  Emotional problems may arise as a secondary consequence of the distress or stigma that results from enuresis, the enuresis may form part of some other psychiatric disorder, or both the enuresis and the emotional/behavioural disturbance may arise in parallel from related etiological factors.  There is no straightforward, unambiguous way of deciding between these alternatives in the individual case, and the diagnosis should be made on the basis of which type of disturbance (i.e. enuresis or emotional/ behavioural disorder) constitutes the main problem.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no clear-cut demarcation between an enuresis disorder and the normal variations in the age of acquisition of bladder control. However, enuresis would not ordinarily be diagnosed in a child under the age of 5 years or with a mental age under 4 years. If the enuresis is associated with some (other) emotional or behavioural disorder, enuresis would normally constitute the primary diagnosis only if the involuntary voiding of urine occurred at least several times per week and if the other symptoms showed some temporal covariation with the enuresis. Enuresis sometimes occurs in conjunction with encopresis; when this is the case, encopresis should be diagnosed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Occasionally, children develop transient enuresis as a result of cystitis or polyuria (as from diabetes). However, these do not constitute a sufficient explanation for enuresis that persists after the infection has been cured or after the polyuria has been brought under control. Not infrequently, the cystitis may be secondary to an enuresis that has arisen by ascending infection up the urinary tract as a result of persistent wetness (especially in girls).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: -60pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">enuresis (primary) (secondary) of nonorganic origin functional or psychogenic enuresis</span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">urinary incontinence of nonorganic origin</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Excludes: <span class="p">enuresis NOS (R32)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F98.1 Nonorganic encopresis</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: left;">Repeated voluntary or involuntary passage of faeces, usually of normal or near-normal consistency, in places not appropriate for that purpose in the</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">individual&#39;s own sociocultural setting. The condition may represent an abnormal continuation of normal infantile incontinence, it may involve a loss of continence following the acquisition of bowel control, or it may involve the deliberate deposition of faeces in inappropriate places in spite of normal physiological bowel control. The condition may occur as a monosymptomatic disorder, or it may form part of a wider disorder, especially an emotional disorder (F93.-) or a conduct disorder (F91.-).</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The crucial diagnostic feature is the inappropriate placement of faeces.  The condition may arise in several different ways.  First, it may represent a lack of adequate toilet-training or of adequate response to training, with the history being one of continuous failure ever to acquire adequate bowel control.  Second, it may reflect a psychologically determined disorder in which there is normal physiological control over defecation but, for some reason, a reluctance, resistance, or failure to conform to social norms in defecating in acceptable places.  Third, it may stem from physiological retention, involving impaction of faeces, with secondary overflow and deposition of faeces in inappropriate places.  Such retention may arise from parent/child battles over bowel-training, from withholding of faeces because of painful defecation (e.g. as a consequence of anal fissure), or for other reasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In some instances, the encopresis may be accompanied by smearing of faeces over the body or over the external environment and, less commonly, there may be anal fingering or masturbation. There is usually some degree of associated emotional/behavioural disturbance. There is no clear-cut demarcation between encopresis with associated emotional/behavioural disturbance and some other psychiatric disorder which includes encopresis as a subsidiary symptom. The recommended guideline is to code encopresis if that is the predominant phenomenon and the other disorder if it is not (or if the frequency of the encopresis is less than once a month). Encopresis and enuresis are not infrequently associated and, when this is the case, the coding of encopresis should have precedence. Encopresis may sometimes follow an organic condition such as anal fissure or a gastrointestinal infection; the organic condition should be the sole coding if it constitutes a sufficient explanation for the faecal soiling but, if it serves as precipitant but not a sufficient cause, encopresis should be coded (in addition to the somatic condition).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">It is important to consider the following:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;">(a)encopresis due to organic disease such as aganglionic megacolon (Q43.1) or spina bifida (Q05.-) (note, however, that encopresis may accompany or follow conditions such as anal fissure or gastrointestinal infection);</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: left;">(b)constipation involving faecal blockage resulting in &quot;overflow&quot; faecal soiling of liquid or semiliquid faeces (K59.0); if, as happens in some cases, encopresis and constipation coexist, encopresis should be coded (with an additional code, if appropriate, to identify the cause of the constipation).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F98.2 Feeding disorder of infancy and childhood</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A feeding disorder of varying manifestations, usually specific to infancy and early childhood. It generally involves refusal of food and extreme faddiness in the presence of an adequate food supply and a reasonably competent care-giver, and the absence of organic disease. There may or may not be associated rumination (repeated regurgitation without nausea or gastrointestinal illness).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Diagnostic guidelines</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Minor difficulties in eating are very common in infancy and childhood (in the form of faddiness, supposed undereating, or supposed overeating). In themselves, these should not be considered as indicative of disorder. Disorder should be diagnosed only if the difficulties are clearly beyond the normal range, if the nature of the eating problem is qualitatively abnormal in character, or if the child fails to gain weight or loses weight over a period of at least 1 month.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Includes: <span class="p">rumination disorder of infancy</span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 27pt;text-align: left;">Differential diagnosis. <span class="p">It is important to differentiate this disorder from: (a)conditions where the child readily takes food from adults other than the usual</span></p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">care-giver;</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(b)organic disease sufficient to explain the food refusal; (c)anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders (F50.-); (d)broader psychiatric disorder;</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(e)pica (F98.3);</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(f)feeding difficulties and mismanagement (R63.3).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F98.3 Pica of infancy and childhood</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Persistent eating of non-nutritive substances (soil, paint chippings, etc).

The phenomenon is most common in mentally retarded children; if mental retardation is also present, it should be coded (F70-79).

When such movements occur as symptoms of some other disorder, only the overall disorder should be coded (i.e. F98.4 should not be used). The movements that are noninjurious include: body-rocking, head-rocking,</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hair-plucking, hair-twisting, finger-flicking mannerisms, and hand-flapping. (Nail-biting, thumb-sucking, and nose-picking should not be included as they are not good indicators of psychopathology, and are not of sufficient public health importance to warrant classification.) Stereotyped self-injurious behaviour includes repetitive head-banging, face-slapping, eye-poking, and biting of hands, lips or other body parts. All the stereotyped movement disorders occur most frequently in association with mental retardation; when this is the case, <span class="s18">both </span>disorders should be coded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Eye-poking is particularly common in children with visual impairment.

Minor dysrhythmias of this type are quite common as a transient phase in early childhood, or as a minor but persistent speech feature in later childhood and adult life.  They should be classified as a disorder only if their severity is such as markedly to disturb the fluency of speech.  There may be associated movements of the face and/or other parts of the body that coincide in time with the repetitions, prolongations, or pauses in speech flow.  Stuttering should be differentiated from cluttering (see below) and from tics.
